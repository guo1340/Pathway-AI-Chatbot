[2] THE TRANSFORMATION OF AG SCHOOLS IN SPRINGFIELD

the AG schools in Springfi  eld‚ÄîCentral Bible College and Evangel University. Central 
Bible College (CBC) has focused for ninety years on undergraduate preparation for 
full-time ministry, while Evangel provides Christ-centered Pentecostal education for 
liberal arts and professional vocations. In the 1960s, J. Robert Ashcroft was president 
of both schools and commuted between campuses for fi  ve years. He desired both 
missions to continue on one campus. Robert Cooley and other leaders initiated mul-
tiple attempts to unite these schools, along with AGTS into one consolidated univer-
sity with an embedded seminary.

solidation with the continuation of all three missions. This prompted a meeting with
