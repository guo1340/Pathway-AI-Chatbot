[2] THE TRANSFORMATION OF AG SCHOOLS IN SPRINGFIELD
For over fi  fty years there have been a variety of attempts to consolidate or merge 
the AG schools in Springfi  eld—Central Bible College and Evangel University. Central 
Bible College (CBC) has focused for ninety years on undergraduate preparation for 
full-time ministry, while Evangel provides Christ-centered Pentecostal education for 
liberal arts and professional vocations. In the 1960s, J. Robert Ashcroft was president 
of both schools and commuted between campuses for fi  ve years. He desired both 
missions to continue on one campus. Robert Cooley and other leaders initiated mul-
tiple attempts to unite these schools, along with AGTS into one consolidated univer-
sity with an embedded seminary. 
In October 2010, the ELT received two reports from concerned faculty urging con-
solidation with the continuation of all three missions. This prompted a meeting with

another in partnership in mission. While representatives meet tri-annually, an execu-
tive committee of fourteen meets every year for the transaction of business. The quar-
terly magazine WorldLink functions as the oﬃ   cial voice and is available through e-mail.

[2] GREG MUNDIS
Greg Mundis was elected the executive director of Assemblies of God World Mis-
sions (AGWM) in 2011 at the 54th General Council. He came to this position with 
more than thirty years of foreign missionary experience in church planting, leader-
ship development, and fi  eld and regional administration. Under the leadership of 
Greg Mundis, AGWM continues to transform its methods and structures to respond 
to opportunities and complete the Great Commission. 
A native of Youngstown, Ohio, Mundis became a born-again believer at age thir-
teen through the ministry of Billy Graham, and was baptized in the Holy Spirit at the 
age of sixteen. While a student at Youngstown State University, he heard the call to 
ministry. He is a graduate of Central Bible College, the Assemblies of God Theolog-
ical Seminary (AGTS), and he earned his doctor of ministry from Gordon-Conwell 
Theological Seminary. This deep commitment to being a “scholar on fi  re” made Mun-

have been in the time of the (spiritual) “latter rain” since the turn of the century, and 
the conviction received in the beginning has been conﬁ rmed again and again that we

our Lord is rapidly drawing nigh. 
Let us guard our heritage with all diligence, praying with all prayer and supplica-

be frustrated or destroyed.

carry the notice, however, Carothers was displaying some caution by writing in his new 
“Grapes and Pomegranates” column (January 15, 1916) that he “would not think of 
launching a new doctrine or new ‘movement’ without consulting the brethren” (p. 9).
In keeping with this concern, the notice sought an expression of interest in such a 
column by “one hundred or more . . . subscribers.” In that Carothers could supposedly 
predict the weather “two weeks or more in advance,” his predictions would have been 
current when the magazine went to press since the lead time for preparing and printing 
each issue was probably two weeks. After the third appearance of the notice, however,
