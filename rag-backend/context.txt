he Bible is our all–suffi  cient rule for faith and practice. This Statement of Fun-
damental Truths is intended simply as a basis of fellowship among us (i.e., that 
we all speak the same thing, 1 Corinthians 1:10; Acts 2:42). The phraseology 
employed in this statement is not inspired or contended for, but the truth set forth 
is held to be essential to a full–gospel ministry. No claim is made that it contains all 
biblical truth, only that it covers our need as to these fundamental doctrines.
1. THE SCRIPTURES INSPIRED
The Scriptures, both the Old and New Testaments, are verbally inspired of God 
and are the revelation of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and 
conduct (2 Timothy 3:15–17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Peter 1:21).
2. THE ONE TRUE GOD
The one true God has revealed himself as the eternally self–existent “I AM,” the 
Creator of heaven and earth and the Redeemer of mankind. He has further revealed

9. SANCTIFICATION
Sanctifi cation is an act of separation from that which is evil, and of dedication 
unto God (Romans 12:1,2; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; Hebrews 13:12). Scriptures teach a 
life of “holiness without which no man shall see the Lord” (Hebrews 12:14). By the 
power of the Holy Spirit we are able to obey the command: “Be ye holy, for I am holy” 
(1 Peter 1:15,16).
Sanctifi cation is realized in the believer by recognizing his identifi  cation with 
Christ in His death and resurrection, and by faith reckoning daily upon the fact of that 
union, and by offering every faculty continually to the dominion of the Holy Spirit 
(Romans 6:1–11,13; 8:1,2,13; Galatians 2:20; Philippians 2:12,13; 1 Peter 1:5).
10. THE CHURCH AND ITS MISSION
The Church is the body of Christ, the habitation of God through the Spirit, with 
divine appointments for the fulfi  llment of her Great Commission. Each believer, born

[3] a. His virgin birth (Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:31,35). 
b. His sinless life (Hebrews 7:26; 1 Peter 2:22).
c. His miracles (Acts 2:22; 10:38).
d. His substitutionary work on the cross (1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
e. His bodily resurrection from the dead (Matthew 28:6; Luke 24:39; 1 Corinthians 
15:4).
f. His exaltation to the right hand of God (Acts 1:9,11; 2:33; Philippians 2:9–11; 
Hebrews 1:3).
4. THE FALL OF MAN
Man was created good and upright; for God said, “Let us make man in our 
image, after our likeness.” However, man by voluntary transgression fell and thereby 
incurred not only physical death but also spiritual death, which is separation from 
God (Genesis 1:26,27; 2:17; 3:6; Romans 5:12–19).
5. THE SALVATION OF MAN
Man’s only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son 
of God.

Do not allow the details to detract from the main thing. 
Prophetic predictions, charts, and debates about the details can be interesting. 
However, they are often a distraction from the main message. It is im portant not to let 
debatable details distract from the important c ore belief in Christ’s coming. The 
imminent return of Jesus  motivates, encourages, and unites us in our mission.  
Show charity to other believers in disagreements over eschatology. 
The Assemblies of God has defined the boundaries of its eschatology with the 
formulation of the Statement of Fundamental Truths. However, the Statement of 
Fundamental Truths does not set the boundaries for being a Christian. We 
recognize that Christians  can d isagree on matters that are not essential to salvation, 
even if it involves the interpretation of Scripture. Eschatology matters, but not all 
Christians hold the same beliefs about eschatology. God has called all Christians to 
s

[6] from the spiritual deadness of the historic churches. They wanted nothing to do with 
lifeless creeds and confessions. Thus, the formulation of the Statement of Fundamental 
Truths amounted to the reluctant swallowing of a bitter pill. Nevertheless, concern to 
protect the faithful from doctrinal error won out. 
Two years later in 1918, internal controversy brewed when old questions resur-
faced over the necessity of tongues as evidence of Spirit baptism. Church leaders 
once again had to refl  ect on the organization’s doctrinal and spiritual identity. After 
much discussion, the Council reaffi rmed the doctrine of initial evidence and high-
lighted it as the “distinctive testimony of the Assemblies of God.”

EXPANDING MINISTRIES
Ministers, missionaries, and laypersons concentrated their energies on many 
different activities in serving God. These included street meetings, revivals, camp 
meetings, church plantings, missions, and other activities. John Welch, the secretary

[7] Jesus.7 In 1961, the General Council responded to a growing number of minis ters 
holding to amillennial views by including a pr ohibition of teaching amillennialism. 8 In 
2023, the General Council revised those bylaws  to emphasize the right to 
address other views for educational purposes, but that ministers should r efrain 
from “intentionally leading others astray” regarding the four core eschatologic al 
teachings of the Assemblies of God.  
The Statement of Fundamental Truths clearly affirms premillennial doctr ine, but it 
is important not to dogm atize other elements  of end-t ime beliefs that ar e not 
specifically addressed. These include details about the identity of the Antichrist (2 
Thessalonians 2:3; 2 John 7), the battle of Armageddon (Revelation 16:16), the m ark of 
the Beast (Revelation 13:16–17), and the Great Tribulation (Matthew 24:21; Revelation 
7:14). While ministers may hav e convictions about specific interpretations of

“Two Kingdoms” and Reformed approaches. In twenty-first-century America, some in the 
AG stressed political power as a way to promote biblical values.  
 
Articles 10 and 11 of the “Statement of Fundamental Truths” describe the mission of the 
Church as evangelizing, worshipping God, building up believers, and showing 
compassion. This mission intersects with the political and social world. Yet, believers who 
aim to glorify God and rightly reflect His kingdom must govern such activities by mission 
principles.

Do not allow the details to detract from the main thing. 
Prophetic predictions, charts, and debates about the details can be interesting. 
However, they are often a distraction from the main message. It is im portant not to let 
debatable details distract from the important c ore belief in Christ’s coming. The 
imminent return of Jesus  motivates, encourages, and unites us in our mission.  
Show charity to other believers in disagreements over eschatology. 
The Assemblies of God has defined the boundaries of its eschatology with the 
formulation of the Statement of Fundamental Truths. However, the Statement of 
Fundamental Truths does not set the boundaries for being a Christian. We 
recognize that Christians  can d isagree on matters that are not essential to salvation, 
even if it involves the interpretation of Scripture. Eschatology matters, but not all 
Christians hold the same beliefs about eschatology. God has called all Christians to 
s

[6] from the spiritual deadness of the historic churches. They wanted nothing to do with 
lifeless creeds and confessions. Thus, the formulation of the Statement of Fundamental 
Truths amounted to the reluctant swallowing of a bitter pill. Nevertheless, concern to 
protect the faithful from doctrinal error won out. 
Two years later in 1918, internal controversy brewed when old questions resur-
faced over the necessity of tongues as evidence of Spirit baptism. Church leaders 
once again had to refl  ect on the organization’s doctrinal and spiritual identity. After 
much discussion, the Council reaffi rmed the doctrine of initial evidence and high-
lighted it as the “distinctive testimony of the Assemblies of God.”

EXPANDING MINISTRIES
Ministers, missionaries, and laypersons concentrated their energies on many 
different activities in serving God. These included street meetings, revivals, camp 
meetings, church plantings, missions, and other activities. John Welch, the secretary

holding to amillennial views by including a pr ohibition of teaching amillennialism. 8 In 
2023, the General Council revised those bylaws  to emphasize the right to 
address other views for educational purposes, but that ministers should r efrain 
from “intentionally leading others astray” regarding the four core eschatologic al 
teachings of the Assemblies of God.  
The Statement of Fundamental Truths clearly affirms premillennial doctr ine, but it 
is important not to dogm atize other elements  of end-t ime beliefs that ar e not 
specifically addressed. These include details about the identity of the Antichrist (2 
Thessalonians 2:3; 2 John 7), the battle of Armageddon (Revelation 16:16), the m ark of 
the Beast (Revelation 13:16–17), and the Great Tribulation (Matthew 24:21; Revelation 
7:14). While ministers may hav e convictions about specific interpretations of

“Two Kingdoms” and Reformed approaches. In twenty-first-century America, some in the 
AG stressed political power as a way to promote biblical values.  
 
Articles 10 and 11 of the “Statement of Fundamental Truths” describe the mission of the 
Church as evangelizing, worshipping God, building up believers, and showing 
compassion. This mission intersects with the political and social world. Yet, believers who 
aim to glorify God and rightly reflect His kingdom must govern such activities by mission 
principles.

9. SANCTIFICATION
Sanctifi cation is an act of separation from that which is evil, and of dedication 
unto God (Romans 12:1,2; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; Hebrews 13:12). Scriptures teach a 
life of “holiness without which no man shall see the Lord” (Hebrews 12:14). By the 
power of the Holy Spirit we are able to obey the command: “Be ye holy, for I am holy” 
(1 Peter 1:15,16).
Sanctifi cation is realized in the believer by recognizing his identifi  cation with 
Christ in His death and resurrection, and by faith reckoning daily upon the fact of that 
union, and by offering every faculty continually to the dominion of the Holy Spirit 
(Romans 6:1–11,13; 8:1,2,13; Galatians 2:20; Philippians 2:12,13; 1 Peter 1:5).
10. THE CHURCH AND ITS MISSION
The Church is the body of Christ, the habitation of God through the Spirit, with 
divine appointments for the fulfi  llment of her Great Commission. Each believer, born

T
he Bible is our all–suffi  cient rule for faith and practice. This Statement of Fun-
damental Truths is intended simply as a basis of fellowship among us (i.e., that 
we all speak the same thing, 1 Corinthians 1:10; Acts 2:42). The phraseology 
employed in this statement is not inspired or contended for, but the truth set forth 
is held to be essential to a full–gospel ministry. No claim is made that it contains all 
biblical truth, only that it covers our need as to these fundamental doctrines.
1. THE SCRIPTURES INSPIRED
The Scriptures, both the Old and New Testaments, are verbally inspired of God 
and are the revelation of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and 
conduct (2 Timothy 3:15–17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Peter 1:21).
2. THE ONE TRUE GOD
The one true God has revealed himself as the eternally self–existent “I AM,” the 
Creator of heaven and earth and the Redeemer of mankind. He has further revealed

[3] a. His virgin birth (Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:31,35). 
b. His sinless life (Hebrews 7:26; 1 Peter 2:22).
c. His miracles (Acts 2:22; 10:38).
d. His substitutionary work on the cross (1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
e. His bodily resurrection from the dead (Matthew 28:6; Luke 24:39; 1 Corinthians 
15:4).
f. His exaltation to the right hand of God (Acts 1:9,11; 2:33; Philippians 2:9–11; 
Hebrews 1:3).
4. THE FALL OF MAN
Man was created good and upright; for God said, “Let us make man in our 
image, after our likeness.” However, man by voluntary transgression fell and thereby 
incurred not only physical death but also spiritual death, which is separation from 
God (Genesis 1:26,27; 2:17; 3:6; Romans 5:12–19).
5. THE SALVATION OF MAN
Man’s only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son 
of God.

Romans 13:7 argues to offer the state worship.  While Christians generally obey and 
submit to earthly authorities, earthly authorities are not absolutes. All submission occurs 
under the umbrella of Christian allegiance to God. His Person and kingdom cannot be 
compared with or subjected to any earthly power. 
 
Witness as Our Core Mission 
For the New Testament writers, being witnesses of God’s reconciling work in Christ is a 
core responsibility of believers . Anything that interferes with this work opposes the 
Christian faith, no matter the motivation. Acting in the name of Christ while  undermining 
the gospel’s presentation and the Church’s mission risks disobedience to Christ (Matthew 
28:19–20). Let it not be said of us that people blaspheme the name of God because of 
us (Romans 2:24). 
 
Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present

Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present  
simplistic answers that create us -vs-them scenarios . Desiring to make a positive 
difference in the world, well-meaning Christians often choose a side and universally adopt 
its stance on all the issues. In so doing, they can alienate others and damage their ability 
to witness to them. In a worst-case scenario, a chosen side might reveal itself as opposing 
Christian faith and virtue.  Christians must be careful in participating in any potentially 
harmful system that does not accurately represent Christ or His kingdom. 
 
Christians should ensure that their civic engagements are in harmony with their core 
task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere .

[7] task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere . 
Believers should take moral stands on issues that matter to God. However, they should 
exercise caution and discernment in how they do so, living as wise agents of Christ ’s 
kingdom. 
 
Salt and Light 
One of Jesus’ best-known teachings contains dual metaphors for Christian engagement 
with the world. “You are the salt of the earth,” He said, and “You are the light of the world” 
(Matthew 5:13–14). In the right measure, salt improves what it touches. Similarly, 
Christians improve their environment. Consider this  test for valid Christian engagement: 
Does our influence make our environment better or worse? 
 
Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in

[8] Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in 
heaven” (Matthew 5:16). Jesus expects His followers to radiate goodness that dispels the 
darkness of evil . The light of their  good works point s to the Father —the Source of 
goodness. It elicits genuine praise for God from those who observe these acts of light . 
Consider another key test  for Christian engagement: Are people drawn to God by our 
public actions and disposition, or are they turned off?

[9] 6 
Love of God and Others 
Jesus was asked, “Of all the commandments, which is the most important?” (Mark 12:28). 
He offered a simple and comprehensive answer: Love God with all your being and love 
others as if they were you. Love is not an add-on; the characteristic of love defines those 
living an authentically Christian faith (John 13:35). 
 
First Corinthians 13 provides the best description of love in the Christian community. This 
list of love ’s characteristics mirrors actions in  every sphere of life, including public li fe. 
Biblical love raises another question: How does our participation in politics and other civic 
duties reflect the criteria of love, regardless of our intentions?  
 
The Role of the Holy Spirit  
All Christians should seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance when engaging in civic and political 
matters. Every aspect of Christian life depends on the Holy Spirit. As in the life of Jesus,

[10] All Christians should seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance when engaging in civic and political 
matters. Every aspect of Christian life depends on the Holy Spirit. As in the life of Jesus, 
the Holy Spirit must play a central role in guiding, facilitating, and empowering believers’ 
private and public lives. Christians engaged in the work of citizenship on their own risk 
the peril faced by the Galatians. They attempted to complete God’s work in the energy of 
the flesh (Galatians 3:3). We must also resist the urge to misuse a spiritual gift to earn  
political approval . To do so would make one no better than the court prophets  of 
Jeremiah’s day , who only prophesied in favor of the king. Are we living  as citizens  
according to the Spirit’s fruit and gifts (Galatians 5:22–23; 1 Corinthians 12, etc.)? 
 
Conclusion 
 
Scripture does not single out one detailed model for Christian participation in civic and

[11] according to the Spirit’s fruit and gifts (Galatians 5:22–23; 1 Corinthians 12, etc.)? 
 
Conclusion 
 
Scripture does not single out one detailed model for Christian participation in civic and 
political spheres. As “the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and conduct,”
5 the Bible does 
offer powerful truths that should guide Christians ’ civic and political lives. T hroughout 
history, Christians have responded as best they could, in different political circumstances, 
as they sought to be faithful  to the Bible  in their unique contexts. From this important 
discussion comes the following summation for careful consideration. 
 
Believers must be mindful of their core identity as people of another kingdom. Allegiance 
to Christ as the only Lord and the defining role as His witnesses is crucial. As Christians 
act in love and as salt and light, under the guiding power of the Holy Spirit, they lead 
others to God, proclaim the gospel, and improve the world around them.

[12] act in love and as salt and light, under the guiding power of the Holy Spirit, they lead

Modern political movements are not centered around God’s destiny for humanity but 
rather focus on their ends. Further, they achieve those ends through power plays that 
rely on the successful domination of others rather than cooperation with the Holy Spirit. 
 
In practical terms, as followers of Christ and ministers of the gospel, we should:

allegiances;

[13] gifts, and healing without the universality of Spirit baptism 
and tongues. There is a real danger, in the words of Earl Creps, 
of a generation of Assemblies of God “post-Pentecostal Pen-
tecostals” that affi  rm the Statement of Fundamental Truths 
and enjoy relationships, but do not seek to practice or pro-
mote Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues.
General Superintendent Wood disputes this pessimistic 
picture in a 2014 centennial interview in Charisma magazine. 
His observations, interviews with leaders, and wide travel 
affi rm that Spirit baptism with the initial physical evidence of 
tongues is alive and growing. He affi  rmed that the statistics 
are imperfect, not refl  ecting practices in thousands of churches in recent years.

ally labeled Pentecostal or charismatic. For much the evangelical world in particular,

[14] notes a signifi cant rise in Pentecostal practices, even among those not tradition-
ally labeled Pentecostal or charismatic. For much the evangelical world in particular, 
praying for healing and miracles, exercising spiritual gifts, trusting the Lord for deliv-
erance, and speaking in tongues are all valid biblical practices. This is a signifi  cant 
change within one generation. 
Cessationism (the belief that the manifestations of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians 
12–14 ceased with the death of the original apostles or the close of the New Testa-
ment canon in the fourth century) is a declining movement as believers of all denom-
inations and theological persuasions affi  rm the contemporary work of the Spirit. 
Though many of these groups do not share the “classical” Pentecostal distinctive 
of tongues as the initial physical evident of Spirit baptism, the affi  rmation that the 
Spirit works in and through all the gifts is a heartening change.

[15] of tongues as the initial physical evident of Spirit baptism, the affi  rmation that the 
Spirit works in and through all the gifts is a heartening change. 
There are some signs across the United States that cause concern among 
thoughtful persons. The number of people that answered “none” when asked for reli-
gious affi  liation has grown from a miniscule percentage in the 1980s to 16.1  per-
cent in a 2007 poll by Pew Research. And 28 percent have left the faith they were 
raised in or affi  liate with no religion at all.
1 This refl  ects two trends: (1) the loss of 
denominational loyalty among some that might still (vaguely) identify themselves as 
Christians; and (2) an increasing number of the U.S. population (both immigrant and 
native-born) with no religious affi liation.  
“Post-Christian” and “postmodern” are labels tossed about with great frequency

[16] “Post-Christian” and “postmodern” are labels tossed about with great frequency 
in popular analysis. The United States remains much more religious than most of 
Western Europe; however, “being spiritual and not religious” is gaining as a category 
of a generation without signifi  cant exposure to the gospel. 
The new challenge for Assemblies of God leaders is evangelization of people with 
no Christian memory. This is a new phenomenon for many U.S. leaders (though not 
for the appointed missionaries of AGWM). 
Another concern among thoughtful adherents is moral compromise with the 
subversion of traditional marriage and sexuality in the last half-century. The public

consensus in the West and the United States of lifelong heterosexual marriage and 
celibacy for singles is no longer the prevailing opinion of popular culture or even 
a majority of people. While strong elements within American society advocate or 
support gay marriage, the Assemblies of God stands fi  rmly committed to scriptural 
teaching that marriage is between a man and a woman.
When confronted by actual or potential compromise in other evangelical or Pen-
tecostal fellowships and organizations, steadfast adherence to biblical marriage is 
quickly affi  rmed. The Assemblies of God leadership has been uncompromising it its 
standards of sexual conduct while affi  rming love for all people broken by sin.

[18] OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD!
The evangelical revivals of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries fueled the 
birth of global missions. The Pentecostal awakenings have accelerated the spread 
of the gospel in the twentieth century. We are now witnesses the re-evangelizing of 
Europe and the United States by missional believers from developing nations. The 
gospel is now going from everywhere to everywhere as former missions fi elds become 
missions-sending agencies. 
When Melvin Hodges penned The Indigenous Church in 1953, the aim of missions was 
a self-sustaining local church and, in the long-term, a self-sustaining national fellow-
ship. These remain important goals; however, a more complete goal is emerging in the 
twenty-fi rst century: establishing churches and fellowships of churches that become 
not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around

[19] not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around 
the world answer the Great Commission call and become “360  Churches.” Mission-
ary-scholars such as Alan Johnson in Thailand are now articulating an integration of 
apostolic pioneering and church planting united with holistic care for communities. 
In the post-Christian West, Pentecostal spirituality and theology are the answer 
for generations that are hungry for experience and meaning rooted in love and truth. 
Apologetics and careful explanations of truth must be united with the proclamation 
of the Cross and power of the Spirit to deliver, heal, forgive, redeem, and transform. 
Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The

[20] Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The 
signs and wonders demonstrated in Scripture are alive and well on the frontiers of 
evangelization and missions today. The Assemblies of God has a bright future as we 
recognize those frontiers across the street and around the world.
Gary McGee’s fi nal work, Miracles, Missions and American Pentecostalism (2010), details 
the supernatural confi rmation of the missionary pioneers. As a new Spirit-empowered 
generation hears the call to evangelism, worship, discipleship, and compassion, they 
can expect the Lord of the harvest to again confi  rm the message of grace.

(Luke 1:35; 1 Corinthians 1:24; Matthew 11:25–27; 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14; 1 John 1:3,4).
(c) Unity of the One Being of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
Accordingly, therefore, there is that in the Father which constitutes Him the Father 
and not the Son; there is that in the Son which constitutes Him the Son and not the 
Father; and there is that in the Holy Spirit which constitutes Him the Holy Spirit and 
not either the Father or the Son. Wherefore, the Father is the Begetter; the Son is the 
Begotten; and the Holy Spirit is the One proceeding from the Father and the Son. There-
fore, because these three persons in the godhead are in a state of unity, there is but 
one Lord God Almighty and His name one (John 1:18; 15:26; 17:11,21; Zechariah 14:9).
(d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor

[22] (d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor 
confused as to relation; nor divided in respect to the godhead; nor opposed as to 
cooperation. The Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son as to relationship. 
The Son is with the Father and the Father is with the Son, as to fellowship. The Father 
is not from the Son, but the Son is from the Father, as to authority. The Holy Spirit 
is from the Father and the Son proceeding, as to nature, relationship, cooperation, 
and authority. Hence, no person in the godhead either exists or works separately or 
independently of the others (John 5:17–30,32,37; 8:17,18).
(e) The Title, Lord Jesus Christ
The appellation Lord Jesus Christ, is a proper name. It is never applied in the New 
Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us

[23] Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us
The Lord Jesus Christ, as to His divine and eternal nature, is the proper and only 
Begotten of the Father, but as to His human nature, He is the proper Son of Man. He 
is, therefore, acknowledged to be both God and man; who because He is God and 
man, is “Immanuel,” God with us (Matthew 1:23; 1 John 4:2,10,14; Revelation 1:13,17).
(g) The Title, Son of God
Since the name Immanuel embraces both God and man, in the one person, our 
Lord Jesus Christ, it follows that the title Son of God describes His proper deity, and 
the title Son of Man, His proper humanity. Therefore, the title Son of God belongs to 
the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23;

(h) Transgression of the Doctrine of Christ
Wherefore, it is a transgression of the doctrine of Christ to say that Jesus Christ 
derived the title Son of God solely from the fact of the Incarnation, or because of His 
relation to the economy of redemption. Therefore, to deny that the Father is a real

a. Conditions to Salvation
Salvation is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord 
Jesus Christ. By the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, being 
justifi ed by grace through faith, man becomes an heir of God according to the hope of 
eternal life (Luke 24:47; John 3:3; Romans 10:13–15; Ephesians 2:8; Titus 2:11; 3:5–7).
b. The Evidences of Salvation
The inward evidence of salvation is the direct witness of the Spirit (Romans 8:16). 
The outward evidence to all men is a life of righteousness and true holiness (Ephe-
sians 4:24; Titus 2:12).
 6. THE ORDINANCES OF THE CHURCH
a. Baptism in Water
The ordinance of baptism by immersion is commanded in the Scriptures. All who 
repent and believe on Christ as Savior and Lord are to be baptized. Thus they declare 
to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with

[26] repent and believe on Christ as Savior and Lord are to be baptized. Thus they declare 
to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with 
Him to walk in newness of life (Matthew 28:19; Mark 16:16; Acts 10:47,48; Romans 6:4).
b. Holy Communion
The Lord’s Supper, consisting of the elements—bread and the fruit of the vine—is 
the symbol expressing our sharing the divine nature of our Lord Jesus Christ (2 Peter 
1:4); a memorial of His suffering and death (1 Corinthians 11:26); and a prophecy of His 
second coming (1 Corinthians 11:26); and is enjoined on all believers “till He come!”
7. THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
All believers are entitled to and should ardently expect and earnestly seek the 
promise of the Father, the baptism in the Holy Spirit and fi  re, according to the com-
mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the

[27] mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the 
bestowment of the gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry (Luke 24:49; Acts 
1:4,8; 1 Corinthians 12:1–31). This experience is distinct from and subsequent to the 
experience of the new birth (Acts 8:12–17; 10:44–46; 11:14–16; 15:7–9). With the bap-
tism in the Holy Spirit come such experiences as an overfl  owing fullness of the Spirit 
(John 7:37–39; Acts 4:8), a deepened reverence for God (Acts 2:43; Hebrews 12:28), an 
intensifi ed consecration to God and dedication to His work (Acts 2:42), and a more 
active love for Christ, for His Word, and for the lost (Mark 16:20).

[28] The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical 
sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts

tongues (1 Corinthians 12:4–10,28), but different in purpose and use.

11. THE MINISTRY
A divinely called and scripturally ordained ministry has been provided by our Lord 
for the fourfold purpose of leading the Church in: (1) evangelization of the world (Mark 
16:15–20), (2) worship of God (John 4:23,24), (3) building a Body of saints being per-
fected in the image of His Son (Ephesians 4:11,16), and (4) meeting human need with 
ministries of love and compassion (Psalm 112:9; Galatians 2:10; 6:10; James 1:27).
12. DIVINE HEALING
Divine healing is an integral part of the gospel. Deliverance from sickness is pro-
vided for in the Atonement, and is the privilege of all believers (Isaiah 53:4,5; Mat-
thew 8:16,17; James 5:14–16).
13. THE BLESSED HOPE
The resurrection of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and their translation 
together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).

[30] together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).
14. THE MILLENNIAL REIGN OF CHRIST
The second coming of Christ includes the rapture of the saints, which is our 
blessed hope, followed by the visible return of Christ with His saints to reign on 
the earth for one thousand years (Zechariah 14:5; Matthew 24:27,30; Revelation 1:7; 
19:11–14; 20:1–6). This millennial reign will bring the salvation of national Israel (Eze-
kiel 37:21,22; Zephaniah 3:19,20; Romans 11:26,27) and the establishment of univer-
sal peace (Isaiah 11:6–9; Psalm 72:3–8; Micah 4:3,4).
15. THE FINAL JUDGMENT
There will be a fi  nal judgment in which the wicked dead will be raised and judged 
according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to

[31] according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to 
everlasting punishment in the lake which burneth with fi  re and brimstone, which is 
the second death (Matthew 25:46; Mark 9:43–48; Revelation 19:20; 20:11–15; 21:8).
16. THE NEW HEAVENS AND THE NEW EARTH
“We, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein 
dwelleth righteousness” (2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 21,22).
Scripture quotations are from the King James Version of the Holy Bible.

9. SANCTIFICATION
Sanctifi cation is an act of separation from that which is evil, and of dedication 
unto God (Romans 12:1,2; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; Hebrews 13:12). Scriptures teach a 
life of “holiness without which no man shall see the Lord” (Hebrews 12:14). By the 
power of the Holy Spirit we are able to obey the command: “Be ye holy, for I am holy” 
(1 Peter 1:15,16).
Sanctifi cation is realized in the believer by recognizing his identifi  cation with 
Christ in His death and resurrection, and by faith reckoning daily upon the fact of that 
union, and by offering every faculty continually to the dominion of the Holy Spirit 
(Romans 6:1–11,13; 8:1,2,13; Galatians 2:20; Philippians 2:12,13; 1 Peter 1:5).

divine appointments for the fulfi  llment of her Great Commission. Each believer, born

T
he Bible is our all–suffi  cient rule for faith and practice. This Statement of Fun-
damental Truths is intended simply as a basis of fellowship among us (i.e., that 
we all speak the same thing, 1 Corinthians 1:10; Acts 2:42). The phraseology 
employed in this statement is not inspired or contended for, but the truth set forth 
is held to be essential to a full–gospel ministry. No claim is made that it contains all 
biblical truth, only that it covers our need as to these fundamental doctrines.
1. THE SCRIPTURES INSPIRED
The Scriptures, both the Old and New Testaments, are verbally inspired of God 
and are the revelation of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and 
conduct (2 Timothy 3:15–17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Peter 1:21).
2. THE ONE TRUE GOD
The one true God has revealed himself as the eternally self–existent “I AM,” the 
Creator of heaven and earth and the Redeemer of mankind. He has further revealed

[3] a. His virgin birth (Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:31,35). 
b. His sinless life (Hebrews 7:26; 1 Peter 2:22).
c. His miracles (Acts 2:22; 10:38).
d. His substitutionary work on the cross (1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
e. His bodily resurrection from the dead (Matthew 28:6; Luke 24:39; 1 Corinthians 
15:4).
f. His exaltation to the right hand of God (Acts 1:9,11; 2:33; Philippians 2:9–11; 
Hebrews 1:3).
4. THE FALL OF MAN
Man was created good and upright; for God said, “Let us make man in our 
image, after our likeness.” However, man by voluntary transgression fell and thereby 
incurred not only physical death but also spiritual death, which is separation from 
God (Genesis 1:26,27; 2:17; 3:6; Romans 5:12–19).
5. THE SALVATION OF MAN
Man’s only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son 
of God.

10. avoid any nationalism or identity politics that elevates political identities and 
obscures a primary allegiance to Christ. Such conduct is divisive, potentially 
idolatrous, and leads away from the Assemblies of God’ s mission to evangelize 
the lost, worship God, disciple believers, and show compassion,  as expressed in 
Articles 10 and 11 of the Statement of Fundamental Truths. 
 
6 “10 Guidelines for Christian Voters,” Pentecostal Evangel, October 14, 1984, 13. Full text: “1. Do not confuse patriotism, national 
pride, and Western culture with Christian faith and practice. 2. Do not confuse secular political activity with the purpose of the church 
nor campaigning with witnessing and preaching. 3. Do not make slanderous or false accusations against your opponents but 
maintain your integrity. Do not consider a brother or sister who is of like precious faith an adversary if he or she holds a different

Romans 13:7 argues to offer the state worship.  While Christians generally obey and 
submit to earthly authorities, earthly authorities are not absolutes. All submission occurs 
under the umbrella of Christian allegiance to God. His Person and kingdom cannot be 
compared with or subjected to any earthly power. 
 
Witness as Our Core Mission 
For the New Testament writers, being witnesses of God’s reconciling work in Christ is a 
core responsibility of believers . Anything that interferes with this work opposes the 
Christian faith, no matter the motivation. Acting in the name of Christ while  undermining 
the gospel’s presentation and the Church’s mission risks disobedience to Christ (Matthew 
28:19–20). Let it not be said of us that people blaspheme the name of God because of 
us (Romans 2:24). 
 
Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present

Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present  
simplistic answers that create us -vs-them scenarios . Desiring to make a positive 
difference in the world, well-meaning Christians often choose a side and universally adopt 
its stance on all the issues. In so doing, they can alienate others and damage their ability 
to witness to them. In a worst-case scenario, a chosen side might reveal itself as opposing 
Christian faith and virtue.  Christians must be careful in participating in any potentially 
harmful system that does not accurately represent Christ or His kingdom. 
 
Christians should ensure that their civic engagements are in harmony with their core 
task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere .

[7] task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere . 
Believers should take moral stands on issues that matter to God. However, they should 
exercise caution and discernment in how they do so, living as wise agents of Christ ’s 
kingdom. 
 
Salt and Light 
One of Jesus’ best-known teachings contains dual metaphors for Christian engagement 
with the world. “You are the salt of the earth,” He said, and “You are the light of the world” 
(Matthew 5:13–14). In the right measure, salt improves what it touches. Similarly, 
Christians improve their environment. Consider this  test for valid Christian engagement: 
Does our influence make our environment better or worse? 
 
Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in

[8] Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in 
heaven” (Matthew 5:16). Jesus expects His followers to radiate goodness that dispels the 
darkness of evil . The light of their  good works point s to the Father —the Source of 
goodness. It elicits genuine praise for God from those who observe these acts of light . 
Consider another key test  for Christian engagement: Are people drawn to God by our 
public actions and disposition, or are they turned off?

[9] 6 
Love of God and Others 
Jesus was asked, “Of all the commandments, which is the most important?” (Mark 12:28). 
He offered a simple and comprehensive answer: Love God with all your being and love 
others as if they were you. Love is not an add-on; the characteristic of love defines those 
living an authentically Christian faith (John 13:35). 
 
First Corinthians 13 provides the best description of love in the Christian community. This 
list of love ’s characteristics mirrors actions in  every sphere of life, including public li fe. 
Biblical love raises another question: How does our participation in politics and other civic 
duties reflect the criteria of love, regardless of our intentions?  
 
The Role of the Holy Spirit  
All Christians should seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance when engaging in civic and political 
matters. Every aspect of Christian life depends on the Holy Spirit. As in the life of Jesus,

[10] All Christians should seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance when engaging in civic and political 
matters. Every aspect of Christian life depends on the Holy Spirit. As in the life of Jesus, 
the Holy Spirit must play a central role in guiding, facilitating, and empowering believers’ 
private and public lives. Christians engaged in the work of citizenship on their own risk 
the peril faced by the Galatians. They attempted to complete God’s work in the energy of 
the flesh (Galatians 3:3). We must also resist the urge to misuse a spiritual gift to earn  
political approval . To do so would make one no better than the court prophets  of 
Jeremiah’s day , who only prophesied in favor of the king. Are we living  as citizens  
according to the Spirit’s fruit and gifts (Galatians 5:22–23; 1 Corinthians 12, etc.)? 
 
Conclusion 
 
Scripture does not single out one detailed model for Christian participation in civic and

[11] according to the Spirit’s fruit and gifts (Galatians 5:22–23; 1 Corinthians 12, etc.)? 
 
Conclusion 
 
Scripture does not single out one detailed model for Christian participation in civic and 
political spheres. As “the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and conduct,”
5 the Bible does 
offer powerful truths that should guide Christians ’ civic and political lives. T hroughout 
history, Christians have responded as best they could, in different political circumstances, 
as they sought to be faithful  to the Bible  in their unique contexts. From this important 
discussion comes the following summation for careful consideration. 
 
Believers must be mindful of their core identity as people of another kingdom. Allegiance 
to Christ as the only Lord and the defining role as His witnesses is crucial. As Christians 
act in love and as salt and light, under the guiding power of the Holy Spirit, they lead 
others to God, proclaim the gospel, and improve the world around them.

[12] act in love and as salt and light, under the guiding power of the Holy Spirit, they lead 
others to God, proclaim the gospel, and improve the world around them. 
 
Modern political movements are not centered around God’s destiny for humanity but 
rather focus on their ends. Further, they achieve those ends through power plays that 
rely on the successful domination of others rather than cooperation with the Holy Spirit. 
 
In practical terms, as followers of Christ and ministers of the gospel, we should:  
 
1. prioritize the gospel and its propagation far above personal and political 
allegiances;

[13] gifts, and healing without the universality of Spirit baptism 
and tongues. There is a real danger, in the words of Earl Creps, 
of a generation of Assemblies of God “post-Pentecostal Pen-
tecostals” that affi  rm the Statement of Fundamental Truths 
and enjoy relationships, but do not seek to practice or pro-
mote Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues.
General Superintendent Wood disputes this pessimistic 
picture in a 2014 centennial interview in Charisma magazine. 
His observations, interviews with leaders, and wide travel 
affi rm that Spirit baptism with the initial physical evidence of 
tongues is alive and growing. He affi  rmed that the statistics 
are imperfect, not refl  ecting practices in thousands of churches in recent years.
A recent Pew Research study evaluating both American and global Christianity 
notes a signifi cant rise in Pentecostal practices, even among those not tradition-
ally labeled Pentecostal or charismatic. For much the evangelical world in particular,

[14] notes a signifi cant rise in Pentecostal practices, even among those not tradition-
ally labeled Pentecostal or charismatic. For much the evangelical world in particular, 
praying for healing and miracles, exercising spiritual gifts, trusting the Lord for deliv-
erance, and speaking in tongues are all valid biblical practices. This is a signifi  cant 
change within one generation. 
Cessationism (the belief that the manifestations of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians 
12–14 ceased with the death of the original apostles or the close of the New Testa-
ment canon in the fourth century) is a declining movement as believers of all denom-
inations and theological persuasions affi  rm the contemporary work of the Spirit. 
Though many of these groups do not share the “classical” Pentecostal distinctive 
of tongues as the initial physical evident of Spirit baptism, the affi  rmation that the 
Spirit works in and through all the gifts is a heartening change.

[15] of tongues as the initial physical evident of Spirit baptism, the affi  rmation that the 
Spirit works in and through all the gifts is a heartening change. 
There are some signs across the United States that cause concern among 
thoughtful persons. The number of people that answered “none” when asked for reli-
gious affi  liation has grown from a miniscule percentage in the 1980s to 16.1  per-
cent in a 2007 poll by Pew Research. And 28 percent have left the faith they were 
raised in or affi  liate with no religion at all.
1 This refl  ects two trends: (1) the loss of 
denominational loyalty among some that might still (vaguely) identify themselves as 
Christians; and (2) an increasing number of the U.S. population (both immigrant and 
native-born) with no religious affi liation.  
“Post-Christian” and “postmodern” are labels tossed about with great frequency

[16] “Post-Christian” and “postmodern” are labels tossed about with great frequency 
in popular analysis. The United States remains much more religious than most of 
Western Europe; however, “being spiritual and not religious” is gaining as a category 
of a generation without signifi  cant exposure to the gospel. 
The new challenge for Assemblies of God leaders is evangelization of people with 
no Christian memory. This is a new phenomenon for many U.S. leaders (though not 
for the appointed missionaries of AGWM). 
Another concern among thoughtful adherents is moral compromise with the 
subversion of traditional marriage and sexuality in the last half-century. The public

consensus in the West and the United States of lifelong heterosexual marriage and 
celibacy for singles is no longer the prevailing opinion of popular culture or even 
a majority of people. While strong elements within American society advocate or 
support gay marriage, the Assemblies of God stands fi  rmly committed to scriptural 
teaching that marriage is between a man and a woman.
When confronted by actual or potential compromise in other evangelical or Pen-
tecostal fellowships and organizations, steadfast adherence to biblical marriage is 
quickly affi  rmed. The Assemblies of God leadership has been uncompromising it its 
standards of sexual conduct while affi  rming love for all people broken by sin.

[18] OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD!
The evangelical revivals of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries fueled the 
birth of global missions. The Pentecostal awakenings have accelerated the spread 
of the gospel in the twentieth century. We are now witnesses the re-evangelizing of 
Europe and the United States by missional believers from developing nations. The 
gospel is now going from everywhere to everywhere as former missions fi elds become 
missions-sending agencies. 
When Melvin Hodges penned The Indigenous Church in 1953, the aim of missions was 
a self-sustaining local church and, in the long-term, a self-sustaining national fellow-
ship. These remain important goals; however, a more complete goal is emerging in the 
twenty-fi rst century: establishing churches and fellowships of churches that become 
not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around

[19] not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around 
the world answer the Great Commission call and become “360  Churches.” Mission-
ary-scholars such as Alan Johnson in Thailand are now articulating an integration of 
apostolic pioneering and church planting united with holistic care for communities. 
In the post-Christian West, Pentecostal spirituality and theology are the answer 
for generations that are hungry for experience and meaning rooted in love and truth. 
Apologetics and careful explanations of truth must be united with the proclamation 
of the Cross and power of the Spirit to deliver, heal, forgive, redeem, and transform. 
Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The 
signs and wonders demonstrated in Scripture are alive and well on the frontiers of

[20] Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The 
signs and wonders demonstrated in Scripture are alive and well on the frontiers of 
evangelization and missions today. The Assemblies of God has a bright future as we 
recognize those frontiers across the street and around the world.
Gary McGee’s fi nal work, Miracles, Missions and American Pentecostalism (2010), details 
the supernatural confi rmation of the missionary pioneers. As a new Spirit-empowered 
generation hears the call to evangelism, worship, discipleship, and compassion, they 
can expect the Lord of the harvest to again confi  rm the message of grace.

relationship, as to its mode is inscrutable and incomprehensible, because unexplained 
(Luke 1:35; 1 Corinthians 1:24; Matthew 11:25–27; 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14; 1 John 1:3,4).
(c) Unity of the One Being of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
Accordingly, therefore, there is that in the Father which constitutes Him the Father 
and not the Son; there is that in the Son which constitutes Him the Son and not the 
Father; and there is that in the Holy Spirit which constitutes Him the Holy Spirit and 
not either the Father or the Son. Wherefore, the Father is the Begetter; the Son is the 
Begotten; and the Holy Spirit is the One proceeding from the Father and the Son. There-
fore, because these three persons in the godhead are in a state of unity, there is but 
one Lord God Almighty and His name one (John 1:18; 15:26; 17:11,21; Zechariah 14:9).
(d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor

[22] (d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor 
confused as to relation; nor divided in respect to the godhead; nor opposed as to 
cooperation. The Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son as to relationship. 
The Son is with the Father and the Father is with the Son, as to fellowship. The Father 
is not from the Son, but the Son is from the Father, as to authority. The Holy Spirit 
is from the Father and the Son proceeding, as to nature, relationship, cooperation, 
and authority. Hence, no person in the godhead either exists or works separately or 
independently of the others (John 5:17–30,32,37; 8:17,18).
(e) The Title, Lord Jesus Christ
The appellation Lord Jesus Christ, is a proper name. It is never applied in the New 
Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us

[23] Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us
The Lord Jesus Christ, as to His divine and eternal nature, is the proper and only 
Begotten of the Father, but as to His human nature, He is the proper Son of Man. He 
is, therefore, acknowledged to be both God and man; who because He is God and 
man, is “Immanuel,” God with us (Matthew 1:23; 1 John 4:2,10,14; Revelation 1:13,17).
(g) The Title, Son of God
Since the name Immanuel embraces both God and man, in the one person, our 
Lord Jesus Christ, it follows that the title Son of God describes His proper deity, and 
the title Son of Man, His proper humanity. Therefore, the title Son of God belongs to 
the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23; 
2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).
(h) Transgression of the Doctrine of Christ

[24] the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23; 
2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).
(h) Transgression of the Doctrine of Christ
Wherefore, it is a transgression of the doctrine of Christ to say that Jesus Christ 
derived the title Son of God solely from the fact of the Incarnation, or because of His 
relation to the economy of redemption. Therefore, to deny that the Father is a real 
and eternal Father, and that the Son is a real and eternal Son, is a denial of the

a. Conditions to Salvation
Salvation is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord 
Jesus Christ. By the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, being 
justifi ed by grace through faith, man becomes an heir of God according to the hope of 
eternal life (Luke 24:47; John 3:3; Romans 10:13–15; Ephesians 2:8; Titus 2:11; 3:5–7).
b. The Evidences of Salvation
The inward evidence of salvation is the direct witness of the Spirit (Romans 8:16). 
The outward evidence to all men is a life of righteousness and true holiness (Ephe-
sians 4:24; Titus 2:12).

to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with 
Him to walk in newness of life (Matthew 28:19; Mark 16:16; Acts 10:47,48; Romans 6:4).
b. Holy Communion
The Lord’s Supper, consisting of the elements—bread and the fruit of the vine—is 
the symbol expressing our sharing the divine nature of our Lord Jesus Christ (2 Peter 
1:4); a memorial of His suffering and death (1 Corinthians 11:26); and a prophecy of His 
second coming (1 Corinthians 11:26); and is enjoined on all believers “till He come!”
7. THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
All believers are entitled to and should ardently expect and earnestly seek the 
promise of the Father, the baptism in the Holy Spirit and fi  re, according to the com-
mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the

[27] mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the 
bestowment of the gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry (Luke 24:49; Acts 
1:4,8; 1 Corinthians 12:1–31). This experience is distinct from and subsequent to the 
experience of the new birth (Acts 8:12–17; 10:44–46; 11:14–16; 15:7–9). With the bap-
tism in the Holy Spirit come such experiences as an overfl  owing fullness of the Spirit 
(John 7:37–39; Acts 4:8), a deepened reverence for God (Acts 2:43; Hebrews 12:28), an 
intensifi ed consecration to God and dedication to His work (Acts 2:42), and a more 
active love for Christ, for His Word, and for the lost (Mark 16:20).

[28] The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical 
sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts 
2:4). The speaking in tongues in this instance is the same in essence as the gift of 
tongues (1 Corinthians 12:4–10,28), but different in purpose and use.

11. THE MINISTRY
A divinely called and scripturally ordained ministry has been provided by our Lord 
for the fourfold purpose of leading the Church in: (1) evangelization of the world (Mark 
16:15–20), (2) worship of God (John 4:23,24), (3) building a Body of saints being per-
fected in the image of His Son (Ephesians 4:11,16), and (4) meeting human need with 
ministries of love and compassion (Psalm 112:9; Galatians 2:10; 6:10; James 1:27).
12. DIVINE HEALING
Divine healing is an integral part of the gospel. Deliverance from sickness is pro-
vided for in the Atonement, and is the privilege of all believers (Isaiah 53:4,5; Mat-
thew 8:16,17; James 5:14–16).
13. THE BLESSED HOPE
The resurrection of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and their translation 
together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).

[30] together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).
14. THE MILLENNIAL REIGN OF CHRIST
The second coming of Christ includes the rapture of the saints, which is our 
blessed hope, followed by the visible return of Christ with His saints to reign on 
the earth for one thousand years (Zechariah 14:5; Matthew 24:27,30; Revelation 1:7; 
19:11–14; 20:1–6). This millennial reign will bring the salvation of national Israel (Eze-
kiel 37:21,22; Zephaniah 3:19,20; Romans 11:26,27) and the establishment of univer-
sal peace (Isaiah 11:6–9; Psalm 72:3–8; Micah 4:3,4).
15. THE FINAL JUDGMENT
There will be a fi  nal judgment in which the wicked dead will be raised and judged 
according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to

[31] according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to 
everlasting punishment in the lake which burneth with fi  re and brimstone, which is 
the second death (Matthew 25:46; Mark 9:43–48; Revelation 19:20; 20:11–15; 21:8).
16. THE NEW HEAVENS AND THE NEW EARTH
“We, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein 
dwelleth righteousness” (2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 21,22).
Scripture quotations are from the King James Version of the Holy Bible.

try. “People who are poor, sick, and hungry need more than money, health, and food,” 
she wrote in 1990. “Like us all, they need meaning in life—a sense of order, a reason 
for living. This is where Christians have so much to offer. If you help people fi nd the 
meaning of life while helping them fi nd a home or get a job, you are helping them at 
the deepest level.”
ROBERT E. COOLEY 
(1930–)
A number of Assemblies of God scholars like Billie Davis 
have made signifi  cant academic contributions. To the hall of 
fame must be added the name of Robert E. Cooley. He was 
born into a pastor’s home in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and his 
father later served as Michigan district superintendent. In 
1952, he married Eilene Carlson and received ordination from 
the Michigan district six years later.
Academic training for the ministry took him from Central

[2] Educators presented in this chapter include Peter C. Nelson, Myer Pearlman, 
Marcus L. Grable, Christine Gibson, and Stanley H. Frodsham. Gibson, founder of 
the independent Zion Bible Institute in Rhode Island, never held credentials with the 
General Council. Yet hundreds of Assemblies of God ministers received their training 
there; her story deserves to be told. Stanley H. Frodsham, long-time editor of the 
Pentecostal Evangel, has also been included. While he did some teaching at CBI, his 
contributions lie in his editorial work and many books. Through these means, he 
contributed to ministerial preparation formally and informally. Many who couldn’t 
attend the Bible institutes depended on the Evangel for instruction, sermon ideas, 
and Sunday School lessons.
PETER C. NELSON
(1868–1942)
Generally, Pentecostals looked down on academic degrees as more of a hindrance 
than help for Spirit-fi  lled ministry. For example, one early Council leader recalled,

[3] buildings: churches, post offi  ces, government offi  ces, libraries, schools. Since they 
were free and open to the public, each one made a profound impact on her life. Hav-
ing gotten permission from her mother to attend a Sunday School class, Davis heard 
the teacher say that Jesus loved her. Now she had not only sat on a chair for the fi rst 
time, she had found hope. “It was the fi  rst time I saw a way out of the fatalism of 
the campgrounds,” she refl  ected. “The rich get richer, the poor get poorer, everybody 
pushes you down, you don’t have a chance. But in Sunday School they said you did
have a chance, because you’re a child of God.”
Libraries opened a whole new world for her, and the public school promised 
her the same education that every other child received. After Davis’s family settled 
down during World War II, she graduated from high school as the valedictorian of her 
class and began working at an aircraft factory in San Diego. Having edited her high

[4] down during World War II, she graduated from high school as the valedictorian of her 
class and began working at an aircraft factory in San Diego. Having edited her high 
school paper, she dreamed of becoming a journalist and wrote to the national Sun-
day School Department in Springfi  eld. Learning of her interest in writing and editing, 
Marcus Grable invited her to assist with the new Sunday School Counselor magazine.
Only nineteen and having a single change of clothes, she arrived in Springfi eld in 
the early 1940s to collect sixteen dollars a week at headquarters. Giving up plans to 
study at the University of Missouri School of Journalism, she began taking classes at

Drury College (now University). It was during this time that she met George Davis, a 
student at Central Bible College. Married in 1945, she was ordained three years later. 
They went to Costa Rica as missionaries in 1957 and eventually were assigned to pro-
mote Sunday Schools throughout Latin America. With George’s skill as a pilot, they 
fl  ew extensively about the region to workshops and conferences.
Years later, Davis graduated with highest honors from Drury and capped her 
training with a doctorate in education at the University of Miami in Florida. Hoping to 
enter a sociology program, she discovered that the university did not offer a doctor-
ate in that area. Finally, she decided to visit the Education Department to see if they

Cheyney, he immediately remembered her address before the Ohio Education Asso-

her into the department and invited her participation on the project.
While enrolled, she directed a federally funded High School Equivalency Pro-
gram. The Miami Herald reported: “Mrs. Davis and her staff are helping 49 young peo-
ple fi nd their way out of the fi  elds and into a college education, vocational training,

In 1952, the Saturday Evening Post carried her story, “I Was a Hobo Kid.” Readers

come out two years earlier). 
School children across the nation have learned and been inspired by her achieve-
ments and confi  dence in public education. When George and Billie made their res-
idence in Springfi  eld, she served for years as professor of behavioral sciences and

Cooley’s inauguration as president of Gordon-Conwell Theo-
logical Seminary in 1981 marked a milestone in North American 
Pentecostalism. “‘Historic’ . . . seemed a tame term,” mused Rus-
sell P . Spittler, a leading theologian in the Council. “A minister of 
the Assemblies of God becomes the head of a leading evangelical 
seminary reaching the conclusion of its fi  rst century of service.” 
The welding of establishment Pentecostalism to evangelicalism, 
which had begun in 1942 with membership in the National Asso-
ciation of Evangelicals, appeared complete.
After retirement as president, Cooley was named chancellor

dents on immigration issues and faith-based organizations, and executive presbyter 
of the Assemblies of God, Miranda has a distinguished record of service to church

Miranda grew up in an unpromising environment: a poor barrio in Albuquerque, 
New Mexico, one of fi ve children born to a sawmill worker who had emigrated from 
Chihuahua State in Mexico and a mother of Spanish descent. He came to Christ at 
an early age after members of a nearby Pentecostal church, who had heard that his 
mother was sick, came to the house and prayed for her. Her healing had a dramatic 
effect on the family and young Jesse. 
The church had been in contact with the family for two years before the healing. 
“This little Pentecostal church would come in an old broken-down-bus, pick us up, 
and take me to church—that made the difference,” Miranda recalled. It was at church 
that he learned to write. At Christmastime, when his parents gave clothes as presents

While growing up, the disciplined lifestyle of his father and the spiritual encour-
agement of his mother strongly infl  uenced him. On one occasion, during a church

become an educated man. She then pointed to a man kneeling at the altar in prayer 
as an example: Joe E. Martinez, an Assemblies of God layman and professor at the 
University of New Mexico. “That’s the image that stuck.”

[15] His parents—a Catholic father and mainline Protestant mother—also mentored 
him in the importance of reconciliation. “I remember I was 13 or 14, and I said, ‘Dad, 
Catholics never read the Bible,’ because I never saw him read it. ‘Mother, you read the 
Bible but never come to the book of Acts.’ And then they would turn around and say, 
‘And you Pentecostals never leave the Book of Acts.’ So I saw my shortcomings and 
I saw differences. Yet we loved and respected one another so that we really enjoyed 
our fellowship. And we all affi  rmed one another.” 
At age sixteen, he began to attend Bible school, and his pastor assigned him 
preaching responsibilities a year later. Like other young people who demonstrated 
leadership abilities in Pentecostal churches, his pastor gave him opportunities to

n late summer 1930, William I. Evans, the “principal” of Central Bible Institute 
(CBI) announced that the school year would begin on September 26, and there 
was still room for more students. “We are looking for Jesus to come and, in conse-
quence of that glorious event, we may never conduct the [term],” he remarked. “We 
thank God for the blessed hope. . . . However, we are occupying till He comes. That 
occupation with us is making this Institute count for the very most in the advance-
ment of the Kingdom.” The school preferred mature and “diligent students of the 
Word,” nineteen years of age and older. Accepting applicants below this age might 
mean that at graduation three years later, they could still be “too young to be trusted 
with the responsibilities involved.”

[20] Evans lamented that fi  nding students with the “highest type of consecration 
among us is getting rarer.” Life at a Bible institute contrasted sharply with campus 
life at colleges and universities. Preeminently an experience in spiritual formation, it 
demanded a high level of dedication to stay the course.
The “standards of holiness” required separation from worldly values. “It grieves 
our hearts and we could weep,” he added in disappointment, “when we see world 
conformity among Bible school graduates!” Women especially seem to have been 
the culprits: “We have seen pastors’ wives and lady pastors and leaders dressed so 
much like the world as to show no line of separation.” Hence, “short skirts, low necks, 
sheer clothes, adornments, and worldly style of hair dress, are inexcusable. Certainly 
religion does not consist in what we wear, but genuine religion of the kind we profess 
will show itself in these matters.” Hopefully, “only . . . serious-minded youths will

[21] religion does not consist in what we wear, but genuine religion of the kind we profess 
will show itself in these matters.” Hopefully, “only . . . serious-minded youths will 
care to apply themselves to [the school’s] rigor.” 
Although strict discipline characterized all the schools, the atmosphere could 
hardly be described as dull or without humor. Instead, both students and faculty 
members shared a common commitment for the evangelization of the world. Refl ect-
ing the desire of church leaders and grassroots believers alike, Evans pleaded, “We 
want all its facilities from walls and roof to the services of consecrated instructors to 
produce the very utmost in lives for the Kingdom.”

[22] PEOPLE OF THE SPIRIT
Alumni from Assemblies of God schools often recall classroom instructors who 
profoundly impacted their lives. Since these institutions were ventures of faith, fac-
ulty members worked long hours, struggled with low pay, and frequently received lit-
tle recognition for their sacrifi cial efforts. In a report published in the Pentecostal Evan-
gel about the 1937 commencement at Latin American Bible Institute in San Antonio 
and the thirty-fi  ve men and women who graduated, the writer attributed the success 
of the school to the sacrifi  ces of the staff: “Much credit is due to Brother Ball and the 
group of workers who have been assisting him as teachers in the school, since funds 
have never been very plentiful so as to enable anyone to be really remunerated for 
his services; but each has given his time and effort willingly as unto the Lord, trusting 
God for the supply of his individual needs.”

[23] his services; but each has given his time and effort willingly as unto the Lord, trusting 
God for the supply of his individual needs.”
Most churches did not fi  nancially support these schools for several reasons: 
First, they sometimes preferred spending their monies on local church ministries 
and/or foreign missions. Second, a long-standing fear of educational preparation 
made many wary of Bible institutes. Third, since the schools operated on faith, God 
would somehow provide for them; indeed, strong fi  nancial backing might jeopardize 
their spiritual vigor. Despite the handicaps that worked against their effectiveness, 
teachers contributed heavily to the spiritual formation of thousands of pastors, evan-
gelists, missionaries, and other church workers.

condition at the homes of the students will prevent many of them from coming to school

yield good dividends in the Kingdom of God. Offerings may be sent to the Foreign Mis-

Bryant’s infl  uence. Enrolling at a Baptist seminary in the Chicago area a year later, he 
found that without an undergraduate degree he was not prepared, so he switched to 
Denison University in Ohio. To cover his expenses, he worked as a manual laborer. 
While there he met his wife, Myrtle Garmong, who then helped him complete the 
program (in seven years).
Still feeling unprepared, he enrolled at Rochester Seminary in 1899. Augustus 
H. Strong, the president and professor of theology, taught the courses in systematic 
theology, and Nelson became one of his students. Strong’s Systematic Theology, fi  rst 
published in 1886, had gone through seven editions and reached nearly twelve hun-
dred pages by the time he got there. “I have discarded none of the Baptist  doctrines,” 
he reminisced many years later, “but have built a story or two on the good solid foun-

[28] he reminisced many years later, “but have built a story or two on the good solid foun-
dation laid for our faith.”
Following graduation, he evangelized and pastored several churches before 
being called to pastor Conley Memorial Baptist Church in Detroit. His contact with 
Pentecostals began in 1920, but they failed to impress him. Nevertheless, a healing 
from a serious and possibly life-threatening infection led him to begin preaching on 
divine healing. But the congregation refused to accept this new teaching, and before 
long he resigned. Shortly after, he was baptized in the Spirit and joined the Assem-
blies of God. 
By now over fi  fty years old and a seasoned minister, he detected that many young 
people in the Assemblies of God were entering the ministry just like he had: with little 
preparation. In 1927 he moved to Enid, Oklahoma, where he founded a church and

known. Before his death, Southwestern Bible School merged with two other schools

MYER PEARLMAN
(1898–1943)
The personalities in this chapter came from widely different backgrounds, and 
Myer Pearlman was no exception. The eldest son of a 
Jewish family, he studied at a synagogue school in Bir-
mingham, England. In school he remembered learning 
the Jewish version of the three R’s: the Jewish faith, the 
Torah (Old Testament), and the Hebrew language. “I was 
taught,” he recalled, “that while I  was to be a patriotic 
Englishman, I was also a Jew, a member of the nation, and 
that I was different from other people. I remember passing 
meat markets, and inwardly thanking God that I did not 
eat unclean meat.”
The economic situation in England forced his  father 
to move the family to the United States in hopes of gain-

[32] meat markets, and inwardly thanking God that I did not 
eat unclean meat.”
The economic situation in England forced his  father 
to move the family to the United States in hopes of gain-
ing employment and improving their living standard. After settling in New York City in 
1915, the younger Pearlman eventually enlisted in the U.S. Army and served eighteen 
months in the medical corps in France. His profi ciency in French helped him in this 
capacity. After the war, he traveled to California where “groping for light I began to 
read religious books and attend services.” 
Sometime later, walking by a mission in San Francisco, he noticed a crowd gath-
ered at the entrance and stopped to listen to the music. On another evening, he 
stood outside again. Mustering his courage, he entered and took a seat. He was par-
ticularly impressed by the music, especially the song “Honey in the Rock,” written by 
F.A. Graves. Based on Deuteronomy 32:13 (“he nourished [Israel] with honey from

[33] ticularly impressed by the music, especially the song “Honey in the Rock,” written by 
F.A. Graves. Based on Deuteronomy 32:13 (“he nourished [Israel] with honey from 
the rock”), it tells of God’s grace and provision from an unexpected source. Verse two 
asks, “Have you ‘tasted that the Lord is gracious?’ Do you walk in the way that’s new? 
Have you drunk from the living fountain? There’s Honey in the Rock [Jesus Christ] 
for you.” Attending nightly, he eventually confessed his sins and became a Christian, 
praying “in the name of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.”
In 1922, Pearlman enrolled at Central Bible Institute, where he later met 
his wife, Irene Graves, daughter of the songwriter. A brilliant student and self-
taught in many areas, he read the Scriptures in Hebrew, Greek, Spanish, French, 
and Italian. At graduation time, the principal, Frank M. Boyd, invited him to join 
the faculty. Pearlman accepted and taught there from 1924 until his death in 1943.

try. “People who are poor, sick, and hungry need more than money, health, and food,” 
she wrote in 1990. “Like us all, they need meaning in life—a sense of order, a reason 
for living. This is where Christians have so much to offer. If you help people fi nd the

the deepest level.”
ROBERT E. COOLEY 
(1930–)
A number of Assemblies of God scholars like Billie Davis 
have made signifi  cant academic contributions. To the hall of 
fame must be added the name of Robert E. Cooley. He was 
born into a pastor’s home in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and his 
father later served as Michigan district superintendent. In 
1952, he married Eilene Carlson and received ordination from 
the Michigan district six years later.
Academic training for the ministry took him from Central

[2] Educators presented in this chapter include Peter C. Nelson, Myer Pearlman, 
Marcus L. Grable, Christine Gibson, and Stanley H. Frodsham. Gibson, founder of 
the independent Zion Bible Institute in Rhode Island, never held credentials with the 
General Council. Yet hundreds of Assemblies of God ministers received their training 
there; her story deserves to be told. Stanley H. Frodsham, long-time editor of the 
Pentecostal Evangel, has also been included. While he did some teaching at CBI, his 
contributions lie in his editorial work and many books. Through these means, he 
contributed to ministerial preparation formally and informally. Many who couldn’t 
attend the Bible institutes depended on the Evangel for instruction, sermon ideas, 
and Sunday School lessons.
PETER C. NELSON
(1868–1942)
Generally, Pentecostals looked down on academic degrees as more of a hindrance 
than help for Spirit-fi  lled ministry. For example, one early Council leader recalled,

[3] buildings: churches, post offi  ces, government offi  ces, libraries, schools. Since they 
were free and open to the public, each one made a profound impact on her life. Hav-
ing gotten permission from her mother to attend a Sunday School class, Davis heard 
the teacher say that Jesus loved her. Now she had not only sat on a chair for the fi rst 
time, she had found hope. “It was the fi  rst time I saw a way out of the fatalism of 
the campgrounds,” she refl  ected. “The rich get richer, the poor get poorer, everybody 
pushes you down, you don’t have a chance. But in Sunday School they said you did
have a chance, because you’re a child of God.”
Libraries opened a whole new world for her, and the public school promised 
her the same education that every other child received. After Davis’s family settled 
down during World War II, she graduated from high school as the valedictorian of her 
class and began working at an aircraft factory in San Diego. Having edited her high

class and began working at an aircraft factory in San Diego. Having edited her high 
school paper, she dreamed of becoming a journalist and wrote to the national Sun-
day School Department in Springfi  eld. Learning of her interest in writing and editing, 
Marcus Grable invited her to assist with the new Sunday School Counselor magazine.
Only nineteen and having a single change of clothes, she arrived in Springfi eld in 
the early 1940s to collect sixteen dollars a week at headquarters. Giving up plans to 
study at the University of Missouri School of Journalism, she began taking classes at

Drury College (now University). It was during this time that she met George Davis, a 
student at Central Bible College. Married in 1945, she was ordained three years later. 
They went to Costa Rica as missionaries in 1957 and eventually were assigned to pro-
mote Sunday Schools throughout Latin America. With George’s skill as a pilot, they 
fl  ew extensively about the region to workshops and conferences.
Years later, Davis graduated with highest honors from Drury and capped her 
training with a doctorate in education at the University of Miami in Florida. Hoping to 
enter a sociology program, she discovered that the university did not offer a doctor-
ate in that area. Finally, she decided to visit the Education Department to see if they

In 1952, the Saturday Evening Post carried her story, “I Was a Hobo Kid.” Readers

Cooley’s inauguration as president of Gordon-Conwell Theo-
logical Seminary in 1981 marked a milestone in North American 
Pentecostalism. “‘Historic’ . . . seemed a tame term,” mused Rus-
sell P . Spittler, a leading theologian in the Council. “A minister of 
the Assemblies of God becomes the head of a leading evangelical 
seminary reaching the conclusion of its fi  rst century of service.” 
The welding of establishment Pentecostalism to evangelicalism, 
which had begun in 1942 with membership in the National Asso-

Miranda grew up in an unpromising environment: a poor barrio in Albuquerque, 
New Mexico, one of fi ve children born to a sawmill worker who had emigrated from 
Chihuahua State in Mexico and a mother of Spanish descent. He came to Christ at 
an early age after members of a nearby Pentecostal church, who had heard that his 
mother was sick, came to the house and prayed for her. Her healing had a dramatic 
effect on the family and young Jesse. 
The church had been in contact with the family for two years before the healing. 
“This little Pentecostal church would come in an old broken-down-bus, pick us up, 
and take me to church—that made the difference,” Miranda recalled. It was at church 
that he learned to write. At Christmastime, when his parents gave clothes as presents

While growing up, the disciplined lifestyle of his father and the spiritual encour-

service, his mother put her arm around him and told him that she wanted him to 
become an educated man. She then pointed to a man kneeling at the altar in prayer 
as an example: Joe E. Martinez, an Assemblies of God layman and professor at the 
University of New Mexico. “That’s the image that stuck.”

[15] His parents—a Catholic father and mainline Protestant mother—also mentored 
him in the importance of reconciliation. “I remember I was 13 or 14, and I said, ‘Dad, 
Catholics never read the Bible,’ because I never saw him read it. ‘Mother, you read the 
Bible but never come to the book of Acts.’ And then they would turn around and say, 
‘And you Pentecostals never leave the Book of Acts.’ So I saw my shortcomings and 
I saw differences. Yet we loved and respected one another so that we really enjoyed 
our fellowship. And we all affi  rmed one another.” 
At age sixteen, he began to attend Bible school, and his pastor assigned him 
preaching responsibilities a year later. Like other young people who demonstrated 
leadership abilities in Pentecostal churches, his pastor gave him opportunities to

n late summer 1930, William I. Evans, the “principal” of Central Bible Institute 
(CBI) announced that the school year would begin on September 26, and there 
was still room for more students. “We are looking for Jesus to come and, in conse-
quence of that glorious event, we may never conduct the [term],” he remarked. “We 
thank God for the blessed hope. . . . However, we are occupying till He comes. That 
occupation with us is making this Institute count for the very most in the advance-
ment of the Kingdom.” The school preferred mature and “diligent students of the 
Word,” nineteen years of age and older. Accepting applicants below this age might 
mean that at graduation three years later, they could still be “too young to be trusted 
with the responsibilities involved.”

[20] Evans lamented that fi  nding students with the “highest type of consecration 
among us is getting rarer.” Life at a Bible institute contrasted sharply with campus 
life at colleges and universities. Preeminently an experience in spiritual formation, it 
demanded a high level of dedication to stay the course.
The “standards of holiness” required separation from worldly values. “It grieves 
our hearts and we could weep,” he added in disappointment, “when we see world 
conformity among Bible school graduates!” Women especially seem to have been 
the culprits: “We have seen pastors’ wives and lady pastors and leaders dressed so 
much like the world as to show no line of separation.” Hence, “short skirts, low necks, 
sheer clothes, adornments, and worldly style of hair dress, are inexcusable. Certainly 
religion does not consist in what we wear, but genuine religion of the kind we profess

[21] religion does not consist in what we wear, but genuine religion of the kind we profess 
will show itself in these matters.” Hopefully, “only . . . serious-minded youths will 
care to apply themselves to [the school’s] rigor.” 
Although strict discipline characterized all the schools, the atmosphere could 
hardly be described as dull or without humor. Instead, both students and faculty 
members shared a common commitment for the evangelization of the world. Refl ect-
ing the desire of church leaders and grassroots believers alike, Evans pleaded, “We 
want all its facilities from walls and roof to the services of consecrated instructors to 
produce the very utmost in lives for the Kingdom.”

[22] PEOPLE OF THE SPIRIT
Alumni from Assemblies of God schools often recall classroom instructors who 
profoundly impacted their lives. Since these institutions were ventures of faith, fac-
ulty members worked long hours, struggled with low pay, and frequently received lit-
tle recognition for their sacrifi cial efforts. In a report published in the Pentecostal Evan-
gel about the 1937 commencement at Latin American Bible Institute in San Antonio 
and the thirty-fi  ve men and women who graduated, the writer attributed the success 
of the school to the sacrifi  ces of the staff: “Much credit is due to Brother Ball and the 
group of workers who have been assisting him as teachers in the school, since funds 
have never been very plentiful so as to enable anyone to be really remunerated for 
his services; but each has given his time and effort willingly as unto the Lord, trusting 
God for the supply of his individual needs.”

[23] his services; but each has given his time and effort willingly as unto the Lord, trusting 
God for the supply of his individual needs.”
Most churches did not fi  nancially support these schools for several reasons: 
First, they sometimes preferred spending their monies on local church ministries 
and/or foreign missions. Second, a long-standing fear of educational preparation 
made many wary of Bible institutes. Third, since the schools operated on faith, God 
would somehow provide for them; indeed, strong fi  nancial backing might jeopardize 
their spiritual vigor. Despite the handicaps that worked against their effectiveness, 
teachers contributed heavily to the spiritual formation of thousands of pastors, evan-
gelists, missionaries, and other church workers.

Bryant’s infl  uence. Enrolling at a Baptist seminary in the Chicago area a year later, he 
found that without an undergraduate degree he was not prepared, so he switched to 
Denison University in Ohio. To cover his expenses, he worked as a manual laborer. 
While there he met his wife, Myrtle Garmong, who then helped him complete the 
program (in seven years).
Still feeling unprepared, he enrolled at Rochester Seminary in 1899. Augustus 
H. Strong, the president and professor of theology, taught the courses in systematic 
theology, and Nelson became one of his students. Strong’s Systematic Theology, fi  rst 
published in 1886, had gone through seven editions and reached nearly twelve hun-
dred pages by the time he got there. “I have discarded none of the Baptist  doctrines,” 
he reminisced many years later, “but have built a story or two on the good solid foun-
dation laid for our faith.”

[28] he reminisced many years later, “but have built a story or two on the good solid foun-
dation laid for our faith.”
Following graduation, he evangelized and pastored several churches before 
being called to pastor Conley Memorial Baptist Church in Detroit. His contact with 
Pentecostals began in 1920, but they failed to impress him. Nevertheless, a healing 
from a serious and possibly life-threatening infection led him to begin preaching on 
divine healing. But the congregation refused to accept this new teaching, and before 
long he resigned. Shortly after, he was baptized in the Spirit and joined the Assem-
blies of God. 
By now over fi  fty years old and a seasoned minister, he detected that many young 
people in the Assemblies of God were entering the ministry just like he had: with little 
preparation. In 1927 he moved to Enid, Oklahoma, where he founded a church and

recognized the need for Pentecostal curricular materials. This led him to write several 
books, including The Young Minister’s Guide (1932) and Bible Doctrines (1934), his best 
known. Before his death, Southwestern Bible School merged with two other schools

missionary service, to come forward, and ﬁ  fty-ﬁ ve responded. The missionary spirit 
in Southwestern has been growing, and many are now ready to go to distant lands as 
soon as they can be sent forth.

MYER PEARLMAN
(1898–1943)
The personalities in this chapter came from widely different backgrounds, and 
Myer Pearlman was no exception. The eldest son of a 
Jewish family, he studied at a synagogue school in Bir-
mingham, England. In school he remembered learning 
the Jewish version of the three R’s: the Jewish faith, the 
Torah (Old Testament), and the Hebrew language. “I was 
taught,” he recalled, “that while I  was to be a patriotic 
Englishman, I was also a Jew, a member of the nation, and 
that I was different from other people. I remember passing 
meat markets, and inwardly thanking God that I did not 
eat unclean meat.”
The economic situation in England forced his  father 
to move the family to the United States in hopes of gain-

[32] meat markets, and inwardly thanking God that I did not 
eat unclean meat.”
The economic situation in England forced his  father 
to move the family to the United States in hopes of gain-
ing employment and improving their living standard. After settling in New York City in 
1915, the younger Pearlman eventually enlisted in the U.S. Army and served eighteen 
months in the medical corps in France. His profi ciency in French helped him in this 
capacity. After the war, he traveled to California where “groping for light I began to 
read religious books and attend services.” 
Sometime later, walking by a mission in San Francisco, he noticed a crowd gath-
ered at the entrance and stopped to listen to the music. On another evening, he 
stood outside again. Mustering his courage, he entered and took a seat. He was par-
ticularly impressed by the music, especially the song “Honey in the Rock,” written by 
F.A. Graves. Based on Deuteronomy 32:13 (“he nourished [Israel] with honey from

[33] ticularly impressed by the music, especially the song “Honey in the Rock,” written by 
F.A. Graves. Based on Deuteronomy 32:13 (“he nourished [Israel] with honey from 
the rock”), it tells of God’s grace and provision from an unexpected source. Verse two 
asks, “Have you ‘tasted that the Lord is gracious?’ Do you walk in the way that’s new? 
Have you drunk from the living fountain? There’s Honey in the Rock [Jesus Christ] 
for you.” Attending nightly, he eventually confessed his sins and became a Christian, 
praying “in the name of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.”
In 1922, Pearlman enrolled at Central Bible Institute, where he later met 
his wife, Irene Graves, daughter of the songwriter. A brilliant student and self-
taught in many areas, he read the Scriptures in Hebrew, Greek, Spanish, French, 
and Italian. At graduation time, the principal, Frank M. Boyd, invited him to join 
the faculty. Pearlman accepted and taught there from 1924 until his death in 1943.

materials for Gospel Publishing House to earn additional money. Before long,

[35] dice and to reconcile social antagonism. The church may offer the world a privatized, 
personal, and ‘spiritual’ brand of Christianity, or it can provide leadership toward a 
more just and humane society exemplifying the kingdom of God.”
Christianity Today noted, “Since the days of playing in backyard junk cars [in the 
barrio], he has not stopped envisioning a better future. Now, he says, his dream is 
that his children and grandchildren will live and work among a broader Christian 
community as a result of his bridge-building.”
The varied endeavors of the persons introduced in this chapter represent the 
notable work of Christian mentors. Paul, too, recognized the value of mentoring when 
he advised his understudy Timothy to “be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus; 
and what you have heard from me through many witnesses entrust to faithful people 
who will be able to teach others as well” (2 Timothy 2:1–2, NRSV).

Over the course of years, he authored three books, wrote hundreds of articles for 
the Evangel and other headquarters’ publications, and became a popular speaker at 
writers’ conferences around the world. Like the Old Testament prophet Habakkuk, he 
told his staff, as well as aspiring writers, that the nature of their work required them 
to “write the vision, and make it plain” (Habakkuk 2:2).
Those who knew Champion remember his ability to affi  rm those with whom he 
worked. When staffers submitted poor articles, he would meet with them person-
ally and review the problems. They would not only leave knowing how to make the 
needed changes, but also feeling positive about themselves and their skills. Friends 
also remember his keen wit.

9. SANCTIFICATION
Sanctifi cation is an act of separation from that which is evil, and of dedication 
unto God (Romans 12:1,2; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; Hebrews 13:12). Scriptures teach a 
life of “holiness without which no man shall see the Lord” (Hebrews 12:14). By the 
power of the Holy Spirit we are able to obey the command: “Be ye holy, for I am holy” 
(1 Peter 1:15,16).
Sanctifi cation is realized in the believer by recognizing his identifi  cation with 
Christ in His death and resurrection, and by faith reckoning daily upon the fact of that 
union, and by offering every faculty continually to the dominion of the Holy Spirit 
(Romans 6:1–11,13; 8:1,2,13; Galatians 2:20; Philippians 2:12,13; 1 Peter 1:5).
10. THE CHURCH AND ITS MISSION
The Church is the body of Christ, the habitation of God through the Spirit, with 
divine appointments for the fulfi  llment of her Great Commission. Each believer, born

T
he Bible is our all–suffi  cient rule for faith and practice. This Statement of Fun-
damental Truths is intended simply as a basis of fellowship among us (i.e., that 
we all speak the same thing, 1 Corinthians 1:10; Acts 2:42). The phraseology 
employed in this statement is not inspired or contended for, but the truth set forth 
is held to be essential to a full–gospel ministry. No claim is made that it contains all 
biblical truth, only that it covers our need as to these fundamental doctrines.
1. THE SCRIPTURES INSPIRED
The Scriptures, both the Old and New Testaments, are verbally inspired of God 
and are the revelation of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and 
conduct (2 Timothy 3:15–17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Peter 1:21).
2. THE ONE TRUE GOD
The one true God has revealed himself as the eternally self–existent “I AM,” the 
Creator of heaven and earth and the Redeemer of mankind. He has further revealed

[3] a. His virgin birth (Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:31,35). 
b. His sinless life (Hebrews 7:26; 1 Peter 2:22).
c. His miracles (Acts 2:22; 10:38).
d. His substitutionary work on the cross (1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
e. His bodily resurrection from the dead (Matthew 28:6; Luke 24:39; 1 Corinthians 
15:4).
f. His exaltation to the right hand of God (Acts 1:9,11; 2:33; Philippians 2:9–11; 
Hebrews 1:3).
4. THE FALL OF MAN
Man was created good and upright; for God said, “Let us make man in our 
image, after our likeness.” However, man by voluntary transgression fell and thereby 
incurred not only physical death but also spiritual death, which is separation from 
God (Genesis 1:26,27; 2:17; 3:6; Romans 5:12–19).
5. THE SALVATION OF MAN
Man’s only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son 
of God.

Articles 10 and 11 of the Statement of Fundamental Truths.

of a generation of Assemblies of God “post-Pentecostal Pen-
tecostals” that affi  rm the Statement of Fundamental Truths 
and enjoy relationships, but do not seek to practice or pro-
mote Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues.
General Superintendent Wood disputes this pessimistic 
picture in a 2014 centennial interview in Charisma magazine. 
His observations, interviews with leaders, and wide travel 
affi rm that Spirit baptism with the initial physical evidence of 
tongues is alive and growing. He affi  rmed that the statistics 
are imperfect, not refl  ecting practices in thousands of churches in recent years.

[6] notes a signifi cant rise in Pentecostal practices, even among those not tradition-
ally labeled Pentecostal or charismatic. For much the evangelical world in particular, 
praying for healing and miracles, exercising spiritual gifts, trusting the Lord for deliv-
erance, and speaking in tongues are all valid biblical practices. This is a signifi  cant 
change within one generation. 
Cessationism (the belief that the manifestations of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians 
12–14 ceased with the death of the original apostles or the close of the New Testa-
ment canon in the fourth century) is a declining movement as believers of all denom-
inations and theological persuasions affi  rm the contemporary work of the Spirit. 
Though many of these groups do not share the “classical” Pentecostal distinctive 
of tongues as the initial physical evident of Spirit baptism, the affi  rmation that the

[7] of tongues as the initial physical evident of Spirit baptism, the affi  rmation that the 
Spirit works in and through all the gifts is a heartening change. 
There are some signs across the United States that cause concern among 
thoughtful persons. The number of people that answered “none” when asked for reli-
gious affi  liation has grown from a miniscule percentage in the 1980s to 16.1  per-
cent in a 2007 poll by Pew Research. And 28 percent have left the faith they were 
raised in or affi  liate with no religion at all.
1 This refl  ects two trends: (1) the loss of 
denominational loyalty among some that might still (vaguely) identify themselves as 
Christians; and (2) an increasing number of the U.S. population (both immigrant and 
native-born) with no religious affi liation.

[8] “Post-Christian” and “postmodern” are labels tossed about with great frequency 
in popular analysis. The United States remains much more religious than most of 
Western Europe; however, “being spiritual and not religious” is gaining as a category 
of a generation without signifi  cant exposure to the gospel. 
The new challenge for Assemblies of God leaders is evangelization of people with 
no Christian memory. This is a new phenomenon for many U.S. leaders (though not 
for the appointed missionaries of AGWM). 
Another concern among thoughtful adherents is moral compromise with the 
subversion of traditional marriage and sexuality in the last half-century. The public

consensus in the West and the United States of lifelong heterosexual marriage and 
celibacy for singles is no longer the prevailing opinion of popular culture or even 
a majority of people. While strong elements within American society advocate or 
support gay marriage, the Assemblies of God stands fi  rmly committed to scriptural 
teaching that marriage is between a man and a woman.
When confronted by actual or potential compromise in other evangelical or Pen-
tecostal fellowships and organizations, steadfast adherence to biblical marriage is 
quickly affi  rmed. The Assemblies of God leadership has been uncompromising it its 
standards of sexual conduct while affi  rming love for all people broken by sin.

[10] OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD!
The evangelical revivals of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries fueled the 
birth of global missions. The Pentecostal awakenings have accelerated the spread 
of the gospel in the twentieth century. We are now witnesses the re-evangelizing of 
Europe and the United States by missional believers from developing nations. The 
gospel is now going from everywhere to everywhere as former missions fi elds become 
missions-sending agencies. 
When Melvin Hodges penned The Indigenous Church in 1953, the aim of missions was 
a self-sustaining local church and, in the long-term, a self-sustaining national fellow-
ship. These remain important goals; however, a more complete goal is emerging in the 
twenty-fi rst century: establishing churches and fellowships of churches that become 
not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata,

[11] not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around 
the world answer the Great Commission call and become “360  Churches.” Mission-
ary-scholars such as Alan Johnson in Thailand are now articulating an integration of 
apostolic pioneering and church planting united with holistic care for communities. 
In the post-Christian West, Pentecostal spirituality and theology are the answer 
for generations that are hungry for experience and meaning rooted in love and truth. 
Apologetics and careful explanations of truth must be united with the proclamation 
of the Cross and power of the Spirit to deliver, heal, forgive, redeem, and transform.

[12] Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The 
signs and wonders demonstrated in Scripture are alive and well on the frontiers of 
evangelization and missions today. The Assemblies of God has a bright future as we 
recognize those frontiers across the street and around the world.
Gary McGee’s fi nal work, Miracles, Missions and American Pentecostalism (2010), details 
the supernatural confi rmation of the missionary pioneers. As a new Spirit-empowered 
generation hears the call to evangelism, worship, discipleship, and compassion, they 
can expect the Lord of the harvest to again confi  rm the message of grace.

relationship, as to its mode is inscrutable and incomprehensible, because unexplained 
(Luke 1:35; 1 Corinthians 1:24; Matthew 11:25–27; 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14; 1 John 1:3,4).
(c) Unity of the One Being of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
Accordingly, therefore, there is that in the Father which constitutes Him the Father 
and not the Son; there is that in the Son which constitutes Him the Son and not the 
Father; and there is that in the Holy Spirit which constitutes Him the Holy Spirit and 
not either the Father or the Son. Wherefore, the Father is the Begetter; the Son is the 
Begotten; and the Holy Spirit is the One proceeding from the Father and the Son. There-
fore, because these three persons in the godhead are in a state of unity, there is but 
one Lord God Almighty and His name one (John 1:18; 15:26; 17:11,21; Zechariah 14:9).
(d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor

[14] (d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor 
confused as to relation; nor divided in respect to the godhead; nor opposed as to 
cooperation. The Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son as to relationship. 
The Son is with the Father and the Father is with the Son, as to fellowship. The Father 
is not from the Son, but the Son is from the Father, as to authority. The Holy Spirit 
is from the Father and the Son proceeding, as to nature, relationship, cooperation, 
and authority. Hence, no person in the godhead either exists or works separately or 
independently of the others (John 5:17–30,32,37; 8:17,18).
(e) The Title, Lord Jesus Christ
The appellation Lord Jesus Christ, is a proper name. It is never applied in the New 
Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us

[15] Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us
The Lord Jesus Christ, as to His divine and eternal nature, is the proper and only 
Begotten of the Father, but as to His human nature, He is the proper Son of Man. He 
is, therefore, acknowledged to be both God and man; who because He is God and 
man, is “Immanuel,” God with us (Matthew 1:23; 1 John 4:2,10,14; Revelation 1:13,17).
(g) The Title, Son of God
Since the name Immanuel embraces both God and man, in the one person, our 
Lord Jesus Christ, it follows that the title Son of God describes His proper deity, and 
the title Son of Man, His proper humanity. Therefore, the title Son of God belongs to 
the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23; 
2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).
(h) Transgression of the Doctrine of Christ

[16] the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23; 
2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).
(h) Transgression of the Doctrine of Christ
Wherefore, it is a transgression of the doctrine of Christ to say that Jesus Christ 
derived the title Son of God solely from the fact of the Incarnation, or because of His 
relation to the economy of redemption. Therefore, to deny that the Father is a real 
and eternal Father, and that the Son is a real and eternal Son, is a denial of the

a. Conditions to Salvation
Salvation is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord 
Jesus Christ. By the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, being 
justifi ed by grace through faith, man becomes an heir of God according to the hope of 
eternal life (Luke 24:47; John 3:3; Romans 10:13–15; Ephesians 2:8; Titus 2:11; 3:5–7).
b. The Evidences of Salvation
The inward evidence of salvation is the direct witness of the Spirit (Romans 8:16). 
The outward evidence to all men is a life of righteousness and true holiness (Ephe-
sians 4:24; Titus 2:12).
 6. THE ORDINANCES OF THE CHURCH
a. Baptism in Water
The ordinance of baptism by immersion is commanded in the Scriptures. All who 
repent and believe on Christ as Savior and Lord are to be baptized. Thus they declare 
to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with

[18] repent and believe on Christ as Savior and Lord are to be baptized. Thus they declare 
to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with 
Him to walk in newness of life (Matthew 28:19; Mark 16:16; Acts 10:47,48; Romans 6:4).
b. Holy Communion
The Lord’s Supper, consisting of the elements—bread and the fruit of the vine—is 
the symbol expressing our sharing the divine nature of our Lord Jesus Christ (2 Peter 
1:4); a memorial of His suffering and death (1 Corinthians 11:26); and a prophecy of His 
second coming (1 Corinthians 11:26); and is enjoined on all believers “till He come!”
7. THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
All believers are entitled to and should ardently expect and earnestly seek the 
promise of the Father, the baptism in the Holy Spirit and fi  re, according to the com-
mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the

[19] mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the 
bestowment of the gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry (Luke 24:49; Acts 
1:4,8; 1 Corinthians 12:1–31). This experience is distinct from and subsequent to the 
experience of the new birth (Acts 8:12–17; 10:44–46; 11:14–16; 15:7–9). With the bap-
tism in the Holy Spirit come such experiences as an overfl  owing fullness of the Spirit 
(John 7:37–39; Acts 4:8), a deepened reverence for God (Acts 2:43; Hebrews 12:28), an 
intensifi ed consecration to God and dedication to His work (Acts 2:42), and a more 
active love for Christ, for His Word, and for the lost (Mark 16:20).
8. THE INITIAL PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical 
sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts

[20] The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical 
sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts 
2:4). The speaking in tongues in this instance is the same in essence as the gift of 
tongues (1 Corinthians 12:4–10,28), but different in purpose and use.

11. THE MINISTRY
A divinely called and scripturally ordained ministry has been provided by our Lord 
for the fourfold purpose of leading the Church in: (1) evangelization of the world (Mark 
16:15–20), (2) worship of God (John 4:23,24), (3) building a Body of saints being per-
fected in the image of His Son (Ephesians 4:11,16), and (4) meeting human need with 
ministries of love and compassion (Psalm 112:9; Galatians 2:10; 6:10; James 1:27).
12. DIVINE HEALING
Divine healing is an integral part of the gospel. Deliverance from sickness is pro-
vided for in the Atonement, and is the privilege of all believers (Isaiah 53:4,5; Mat-
thew 8:16,17; James 5:14–16).
13. THE BLESSED HOPE
The resurrection of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and their translation 
together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).

[22] together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).
14. THE MILLENNIAL REIGN OF CHRIST
The second coming of Christ includes the rapture of the saints, which is our 
blessed hope, followed by the visible return of Christ with His saints to reign on 
the earth for one thousand years (Zechariah 14:5; Matthew 24:27,30; Revelation 1:7; 
19:11–14; 20:1–6). This millennial reign will bring the salvation of national Israel (Eze-
kiel 37:21,22; Zephaniah 3:19,20; Romans 11:26,27) and the establishment of univer-
sal peace (Isaiah 11:6–9; Psalm 72:3–8; Micah 4:3,4).
15. THE FINAL JUDGMENT
There will be a fi  nal judgment in which the wicked dead will be raised and judged 
according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to

[23] according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to 
everlasting punishment in the lake which burneth with fi  re and brimstone, which is 
the second death (Matthew 25:46; Mark 9:43–48; Revelation 19:20; 20:11–15; 21:8).
16. THE NEW HEAVENS AND THE NEW EARTH
“We, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein 
dwelleth righteousness” (2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 21,22).
Scripture quotations are from the King James Version of the Holy Bible.

Romans 13:7 argues to offer the state worship.  While Christians generally obey and 
submit to earthly authorities, earthly authorities are not absolutes. All submission occurs 
under the umbrella of Christian allegiance to God. His Person and kingdom cannot be 
compared with or subjected to any earthly power. 
 
Witness as Our Core Mission 
For the New Testament writers, being witnesses of God’s reconciling work in Christ is a 
core responsibility of believers . Anything that interferes with this work opposes the 
Christian faith, no matter the motivation. Acting in the name of Christ while  undermining 
the gospel’s presentation and the Church’s mission risks disobedience to Christ (Matthew 
28:19–20). Let it not be said of us that people blaspheme the name of God because of 
us (Romans 2:24). 
 
Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present

[27] us (Romans 2:24). 
 
Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present  
simplistic answers that create us -vs-them scenarios . Desiring to make a positive 
difference in the world, well-meaning Christians often choose a side and universally adopt 
its stance on all the issues. In so doing, they can alienate others and damage their ability 
to witness to them. In a worst-case scenario, a chosen side might reveal itself as opposing 
Christian faith and virtue.  Christians must be careful in participating in any potentially 
harmful system that does not accurately represent Christ or His kingdom. 
 
Christians should ensure that their civic engagements are in harmony with their core 
task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere .

[28] task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere . 
Believers should take moral stands on issues that matter to God. However, they should 
exercise caution and discernment in how they do so, living as wise agents of Christ ’s 
kingdom. 
 
Salt and Light 
One of Jesus’ best-known teachings contains dual metaphors for Christian engagement 
with the world. “You are the salt of the earth,” He said, and “You are the light of the world” 
(Matthew 5:13–14). In the right measure, salt improves what it touches. Similarly, 
Christians improve their environment. Consider this  test for valid Christian engagement: 
Does our influence make our environment better or worse? 
 
Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in

[29] Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in 
heaven” (Matthew 5:16). Jesus expects His followers to radiate goodness that dispels the 
darkness of evil . The light of their  good works point s to the Father —the Source of 
goodness. It elicits genuine praise for God from those who observe these acts of light . 
Consider another key test  for Christian engagement: Are people drawn to God by our 
public actions and disposition, or are they turned off?

[30] 6 
Love of God and Others 
Jesus was asked, “Of all the commandments, which is the most important?” (Mark 12:28). 
He offered a simple and comprehensive answer: Love God with all your being and love 
others as if they were you. Love is not an add-on; the characteristic of love defines those 
living an authentically Christian faith (John 13:35). 
 
First Corinthians 13 provides the best description of love in the Christian community. This 
list of love ’s characteristics mirrors actions in  every sphere of life, including public li fe. 
Biblical love raises another question: How does our participation in politics and other civic 
duties reflect the criteria of love, regardless of our intentions?  
 
The Role of the Holy Spirit  
All Christians should seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance when engaging in civic and political 
matters. Every aspect of Christian life depends on the Holy Spirit. As in the life of Jesus,

[31] All Christians should seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance when engaging in civic and political 
matters. Every aspect of Christian life depends on the Holy Spirit. As in the life of Jesus, 
the Holy Spirit must play a central role in guiding, facilitating, and empowering believers’ 
private and public lives. Christians engaged in the work of citizenship on their own risk 
the peril faced by the Galatians. They attempted to complete God’s work in the energy of 
the flesh (Galatians 3:3). We must also resist the urge to misuse a spiritual gift to earn  
political approval . To do so would make one no better than the court prophets  of 
Jeremiah’s day , who only prophesied in favor of the king. Are we living  as citizens  
according to the Spirit’s fruit and gifts (Galatians 5:22–23; 1 Corinthians 12, etc.)? 
 
Conclusion 
 
Scripture does not single out one detailed model for Christian participation in civic and

[32] according to the Spirit’s fruit and gifts (Galatians 5:22–23; 1 Corinthians 12, etc.)? 
 
Conclusion 
 
Scripture does not single out one detailed model for Christian participation in civic and 
political spheres. As “the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and conduct,”
5 the Bible does 
offer powerful truths that should guide Christians ’ civic and political lives. T hroughout 
history, Christians have responded as best they could, in different political circumstances, 
as they sought to be faithful  to the Bible  in their unique contexts. From this important 
discussion comes the following summation for careful consideration. 
 
Believers must be mindful of their core identity as people of another kingdom. Allegiance 
to Christ as the only Lord and the defining role as His witnesses is crucial. As Christians 
act in love and as salt and light, under the guiding power of the Holy Spirit, they lead 
others to God, proclaim the gospel, and improve the world around them.

[33] act in love and as salt and light, under the guiding power of the Holy Spirit, they lead 
others to God, proclaim the gospel, and improve the world around them. 
 
Modern political movements are not centered around God’s destiny for humanity but 
rather focus on their ends. Further, they achieve those ends through power plays that 
rely on the successful domination of others rather than cooperation with the Holy Spirit. 
 
In practical terms, as followers of Christ and ministers of the gospel, we should:  
 
1. prioritize the gospel and its propagation far above personal and political 
allegiances;

📄 Context Sent to Model:
[1] young legal secretary suffering from severe physical and nervous exhaustion. Within 
days her friends marveled at how healthy she looked. Jones’s family had attended a 
Methodist church in Victoria, British Columbia, when Price arrived to hold an evan-
gelistic campaign. As a result, her family came into the Pentecostal movement. Her 
father, baptized in the Spirit during the meetings, felt called to the ministry. He later 
pastored and served as a district offi cial.
After her healing, Gwendoline (Gwen) Jones resigned her job and took up res-
idence in Seattle, where she enrolled at Northwest Bible Institute (now Northwest 
College). Her music training and editing of the college yearbook refl  ected the two 
great interests of her life: music and journalism. After graduation in 1939, she moved 
to Springfi  eld at the request of Noel Perkin, the missionary secretary, who had stayed 
in their home while preaching in her father’s church. “She came [to Springfi eld], and

[2] In 1965, Jones became the founding editor of 
Advance, a new minister’s magazine. Church lead-
ers wanted a person who understood the various 
departmental programs at headquarters as well as 
Council policies and doctrines. Few could fi  ll the 
bill better. In recognition of her accomplishments, 
the Evangelical Press Association elected her to its 
board of directors.
Over the years, Jones demonstrated the min-
istry that women could have in print media. She 
modeled effective leadership professionally and spiritually. “She demanded of herself 
the higher road of skills and effi  ciency; mediocrity was not in her vocabulary or behav-
ior,” remembers Projects Director Carol Ball. Women at the headquarters saw her as a 
mentor who enabled them to fi  nd their own way into productive ministry. “Observing 
Gwen, talking with her, seeking her counsel about routine questions,” added Ball, 
“helped me defi  ne the importance of my calling, the direction of my profession, and

[3] Sometimes single women missionaries teamed up for a 
work. Such was the case of Margaret J. Brown and Marcella 
Dorff, long-term missionaries to Indonesia. Margaret Brown 
arrived fi  rst, in 1945, along with her brother Elbert and his 
wife, Frances. After graduating from Northwest Bible Insti-
tute in Seattle, Wash ington (later Northwest College in Kirk-
land), Brown helped a classmate, Marie Dressler, in ministry 
in Idaho. A heart ailment, however, forced Brown’s return to 
Seattle. One night, struggling with her call to Indonesia, but 
aware that her heart condition disqualifi  ed her for appoint-
ment, she recommitted her life to Christ. “That night the Lord 
defi nitely healed me,” she wrote. “I  returned to the doctor 
who was astounded by my apparent good health!”
From the beginning of her ministry in Djakarta, Brown became involved in 
Bible school teaching. “A regular day’s work begins early,” she remembered, “usu-

[4] evangelist, John J. Ashcroft, went and sat beside her and prayed with her. Her conver-
sion and Spirit baptism at that meeting changed her life. She began to witness to her 
friends and, at age sixteen, she dedicated her life to full-time ministry.
Ashcroft and his wife began to mentor Hammond and invited her to accompany 
them to Martinsburg, West Virginia, where he was scheduled to preach. By Pente-
costal standards, the services seemed dry and without demonstration of the power 
of God. Finally, before a Saturday evening service, he invited her to preach. While 
the congregation sang, Hammond desperately prayed to receive a message from the 
Lord. He “dropped into her heart” the verse, “O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched 
you, that ye should not obey the truth [?]” (Galatians 3:1, KJV). 
Stepping to the pulpit, she quoted the verse, paused momentarily, and then 
quoted it again. Without being able to launch into a sermon, she looked at the con-

ull-time ministry in the Assemblies of God has always appeared to be the 
domain of pastors, evangelists, and missionaries. On closer examination, the 
ministries of editors, writers, and educators have also been indispensable to the 
mission of the Church. Furthermore, whether working at the denominational head-
quarters in Springfi eld, Missouri, or teaching in colleges and seminaries, such people 
have played crucial parts in building the reputation for doctrinal stability that the 
General Council has enjoyed. 
Over the years, Gospel Publishing House (GPH) and the headquarters operation 
have been lightning rods for the criticism of those who mistrust the work of church 
bureaucracies. Editors, writers, managers, printers, artists, secretaries, mail clerks, 
and food servers don’t attain the kind of glamour that Pentecostals usually associate 
with power-packed ministry. Yet, such persons turn the wheels of church machinery

spent years writing and editing church publications to inspire and disciple the people 
in the pew and keep revival fi res burning.
The dedication required for their ministries 
compares favorably with that required of other 
endeavors in the General Council. Among those 
rarely in the limelight, Dorothy Morris and artist 
Norman Pearsall labored long in the preparation 
of Sunday School literature. (In a chapel service 
at Central Bible College, Pearsall once quipped, 
“God called me to preach until He heard me!” In 
any event, he became a gifted artist with a deep 
devotion to ministry.) Dorothy Kirschke, a sec-
retary in the music department, played a major 
part in the preparation of Hymns of Glorious Praise 
(1969), the fi  rst hymnal (rather than gospel song-
book like Melodies of Praise) produced by GPH.

Joyce Wells Booze, Janet Walker, and Beverly 
Graham placed the urgency of missions before

formerly the monthly missionary magazine of 
the Assemblies of God. Juleen Turnage ably represented the Assemblies of God to 
its public constituencies through her service as director of public relations, gaining 
widespread respect for her work during the televangelist scandals of the 1980s.
The roll call gets much longer for church publications when one adds faculty 
members in Assemblies of God schools, many of whom have enlarged the scope of 
their ministries by writing as well as teaching at overseas training schools during the 
summers.

We Called Him T.J.
T
he words of our little old professor’s prayer were 
always the same as, without warning, he bowed his 
snowy white head to commence class, “Open our eyes 
that we may behold wondrous things out of Thy Word and 
bless these precious students for Jesus’ sake. Amen.” As 
students at North Central Bible College there was no doubt 
in our minds that the Reverend T.J. Jones was deeply con-
cerned about our hearts, our minds, and our ministry to a 
lost and dying world. 
We students who were reared in Sunday school con-
sidered the ﬁ rst ﬁ ve books of the Holy Bible, known as 
the Pentateuch, to be extremely boring and nonessential. 
Most of us were completely unfamiliar with its content, except for a few action-packed 
stories. Our feelings about the Old Testament, and the Pentateuch in particular, soon 
began to change as this advanced student of the Word made these books come alive.

[12] stories. Our feelings about the Old Testament, and the Pentateuch in particular, soon 
began to change as this advanced student of the Word made these books come alive. 
Nothing was omitted as T.J. read aloud every single verse, explaining each term 
and deﬁ  ning various individual words. A big, black Bible was always at his side, but he 
much preferred reading from small, separate paperback books of the Bible. They were 
much easier for him to hold close to his face as he sat on a high stool with both arms 
resting on the lectern. 
Fifty years of strenuous preaching had greatly taxed the voice of our lovable 
instructor. It wasn’t exactly melodious as he spoke into the small microphone clipped 
to his lapel. But, oh, the truths that came forth from that scholar of the Word! We con-
sidered him a scholar because he could tell us what was in every chapter of the Bible 
and could quote most of it, too. But T.J. thought of himself as “just a student” of God’s 
precious Word.

[13] sidered him a scholar because he could tell us what was in every chapter of the Bible 
and could quote most of it, too. But T.J. thought of himself as “just a student” of God’s 
precious Word. 
Our predecessors frequently tried to tell us that we should have heard T.J. Jones 20 
years ago or more when he was really ﬁ  ery and full of life. Our retort was simply, “T.J. 
knows more now.” We reasoned that a man would have to be wiser after studying the 
Bible every day for that many additional years. Besides, his brilliant mind was still as 
sharp as a tack. 
The quaint old gentleman, who knew what he was talking about, often interspersed 
nuggets of personal wisdom in his teaching of the Scriptures. Since “One hamburger 
was cheaper than two,” he didn’t marry until after he had pioneered a few churches. 
Continually T.J. encouraged the young men to get their books ﬁ  rst, then their Buick, and 
last of all their bride. Some advice was hard to follow.

T.J. wasn’t able to move about as he wanted to when he became excited, but that 
didn’t keep him from dramatizing Moses’ reply to Pharaoh, “Not a hoof shall be left 
behind!” Not even Leviticus was dry after T. J. Jones got done with it. His words held 
true, “The drier the book, the more it burns.” 
The complex study of Daniel and Revelation was diﬃ   cult for most of us, and even 
after weeks in the class many things weren’t clear in our minds. Often T.J. asked a diﬃ  cult 
question and no one was able to answer. His expression would change to one of despair

as he asked, “Have I been with you so long and still you do not know?” After a lengthy 
pause he would begin to go through the material until our minds were enlightened. 
The Jones’ course in typology was considerably less diﬃ   cult with the aid of a com-
plete full-scale model of the tabernacle in front of the class. Sometimes he would get 
so thrilled while teaching that he’d start to sing. An original song of his was about going 
through the courtyard and Holy Place and into the Holy of Holies. His creaky singing 
was thoroughly enjoyed by all of us, but he would stop abruptly and blurt out, “You 
don’t want to hear me sing.” Not too many days passed, though, until he’d get the urge 
to sing for us again.

[16] to sing for us again. 
T. J. Jones lived to preach and teach God’s Holy Word. He always came to class with 
an armful of books, including a notebook stuffed full with notes sticking out each side 
of it. His organization was such that only he could ﬁ  gure it out. When reading from one 
page fastened in the notebook, he would suddenly pull out a slip of paper from another 
part. Scribbled on it would be a continuation of what he was reading or an augmen-
tation to it. When he ﬁ nished with the piece he would jam it back in somewhere—or 
anywhere—who knows? 
A “scrap” he pulled out one day was an old tattered Christmas church bulletin on 
which he had jotted some valuable notes. How he could ﬁ  gure out such a seemingly 
disorganized system was amazing to us. 
Never was Brother Jones to be interrupted while teaching. When such an event hap-

[17] Never was Brother Jones to be interrupted while teaching. When such an event hap-
pened, it was evident he was not pleased. Whenever a fellow walked into class late, T.J. 
would stop immediately and begin to question, “Young man, was your tea too hot or 
are you trying to impress the girls?” If T. J. then gave his unmistakable giggle with three 
ﬁ ngers raised in front of his mouth, we knew everything was all right. But that wasn’t 
always the case. Whenever he was late, though, he blamed it on the slow elevator. 
Heartfelt concern for students marked the ministry of T. J. Jones at North Central 
Bible College. Besides increasing our head knowledge of God’s Word, he daily encour-
aged us to hide it in our hearts that we might not sin against God. It was also this great 
man’s joy to bear students’ burdens whenever he was asked to pray in chapel. After

[18] man’s joy to bear students’ burdens whenever he was asked to pray in chapel. After 
reading the requests, he would place the cards in his hands and raise them high as he 
poured out his soul to the Lord. Prayers were answered. 
Occasionally he spoke about getting old and assured us that the song “Beautiful 
Isle of Somewhere” was deﬁ  nitely not going to be heard at his funeral. In a determined 
voice he explained that he was not going to a beautiful isle somewhere, but he was 
going to heaven to see his Jesus! 
On July 17, 1970, Jesus Christ became T.J.’s joy of heaven and no longer his hope 
of earth. Sure enough, not a strain of “Beautiful Isle of Somewhere” was heard at that 
glorious funeral. Instead the air was ﬁ  lled with the melodies of his favorite songs: “All 
the Way My Saviour Leads Me,” “God Will Take Care of You,” “Face to Face,” and “Jesus 
Led Me All the Way.” 
We surely miss Rev. Thomas James Jones, but we know heaven is happier with the 
presence of such a saint.

[20] Before his departure, Perkin had recommended that he read two books by Roland 
Allen, Missionary Methods: St. Paul’s or Ours? (1912) and The Spontaneous Expansion of the 
Church and the Causes Which Hinder It (1927). Hodges’s assignment to work with Ralph D. 
Williams, an understudy of Alice E. Luce, afforded him the opportunity to learn fi rst-
hand within a context already being fashioned by the teachings of Allen. Eventually, 
El Salvador became a showcase of church planting. 
After ten months there, Melvin and Lois and their family moved to Matagalpa, 
Nicaragua. They traveled extensively to survey the churches, often living in primitive 
conditions. Convinced that training would best equip national ministers to reach 
their own people, he founded a Bible institute in Matagalpa. Those who enrolled 
were required to combine their studies with evangelism and church planting.

After Hodges’s arrival in Central America, his penchant for writing became evi-
dent: A steady stream of letters and reports fl  owed from his pen to church publica-
tions. Using a simple style, he wrote in English and Spanish to the common person.
At the close of their second term in 1944, the Hodgeses returned to the United 
States physically exhausted. He accepted an invitation to the headquarters in Spring-
fi eld, Missouri, and worked for fi  ve years as editor of mission publications. In 1948, he 
became the founding editor of Missionary Forum, an in-house publication for missionary 
personnel. Using this as his pulpit, Hodges heralded the values of building self-sup-
porting churches. In this, he joined with the missionary secretary, Noel Perkin, who

the many orphanages and charitable institutions they supported. Perkin reasoned that 
“the material and physical need of the people in many lands is relatively unlimited, so 
that all available missionary funds could readily be absorbed in such work.” Still, he 
credited the home constituency with a continuing interest in the needy, observing that 
fi nancial appeals from these efforts consistently gained responses when others failed. 
For Hodges and Perkin, both of whom deeply cared about suffering people, charitable 
ministries represented by-products of evangelism, not primary means to that end.

[23] Yet it is fair to say that mission leaders sometimes misjudged the value of chari-
table institutions in countries like Egypt and India for training church leaders. In Ted 
and Estelle Vassar’s orphanage in South India, young men who desired to enter the 
ministry were encouraged to “learn a trade along with their Bible training. They were 
admonished not to rely solely on the Western Church for their support. From child-
hood, the orphans had chores for which they received an allowance and they were 
taught to tithe.” Notable Indian church leaders emerged from this institution with an 
abiding appreciation for their tutelage.
In 1951, the Foreign Missions Department invited Hodges to address a special 
gathering of missionaries. His lectures formed the basis for what would become his 
best-known book, The Indigenous Church, published two years later. Noting one of the

ability—not unlike the rugged fi  shermen who fi  rst followed the Lord.” 
After a third term in Central America, Hodges again returned to Springfi  eld, 
this time to become fi  eld secretary for Latin America and the West Indies. He began 
his job by overseeing the activities of nearly two hundred missionaries, planning 
strategy, and developing specialized ministries in radio, literature, and ministerial 
training. Over the years he and other leaders retrained the entire missionary force in 
understanding the nature of indigenous church principles and how to apply them. 
Not surprisingly, this changed the relationship of missionaries with national church 
leaders from one of paternal control to partnership.

[26] At the same time, charitable institutions continued and new ones developed; 
gradually the Assemblies of God developed a holistic theology of mission. In this 
respect, the practice of its mission program has been a pilgrimage: a long-standing 
resolve to be true to the Great Commission, along with a search to understand its 
implications for caring for the impoverished and despised.
Hodges contributed to the education of thousands of missionaries (both Pente-
costal and non-Pentecostal), who in turn prepared many more thousands of pastors, 
evangelists, and church workers. In addition, he became the leading Pentecostal mis-
siologist and the fi  rst to be published outside of denominational publications; his 
public became worldwide.
At sixty-four years of age and after twenty years’ service as fi  eld secretary, he

. . . . The ﬁ  rst Bible school in Indonesia opened in 1947, shortly after World War II 
ended. Missionaries Raymond and Beryl E. Busby started a night school in [Djakarta], 
the capital of Indonesia. Most of the men who pastor the 80 to 85 Assemblies of God 
churches on the island of Java were trained at this original night school and a school 
established later in Malang.

Marcella Dorff grew up in Fargo, North Dakota, and 
enrolled at North Central Bible College in Minneapolis, Min-
nesota. From the time of her conversion, she heard the call to 
missions. While still in Fargo, she had a vision while in prayer 
and saw “brown skinned people coming down a mountain to 
hear the Word and they were so happy.” At North Central her 
interest grew, but she hesitated to tell anyone lest her dream 
not come true. She asked the Lord to give her a sign by hav-
ing someone else confi  rm the call to her.
During her junior year, the Lord impressed on her the 
spiritual needs of Indonesia. Reminding Him of her request, 
she suddenly remembered the fate of Zechariah, father of John the Baptist, who also 
demanded a sign (Luke 1:18–20). “Icy chills ran down my back,” she remembered, “and

[30] she suddenly remembered the fate of Zechariah, father of John the Baptist, who also

I said, ‘Lord, I can’t be stricken dumb, I am in school and I must earn my living.’ In 
a fl  ash it was made plain what God was trying to show me and I  said ‘Yes, [that] 
I believed it was God’s will and I would tell others about my call.’”
Finishing her studies, Dorff went to Owatonna, Min nesota, and spent fi ve years 
pioneering an Assemblies of God church. Lessons of faith learned there prepared her 
for the mission fi  eld. On one occasion she asked a real estate agent to help her fi nd 
a new place of worship with only ten dollars “between [me] and the church.” A house 
was purchased, and nine months later so were several lots for the construction of a 
church building—“God helped us to meet every payment.”

Dorff departed for Indonesia in December 1952. Visiting Gambangwaluh in a 
remote area sometime later, she saw people walking down mountain paths to attend 
the church there. Observing this, she said, “I was reminded of what I had seen when 
I was fi rst saved.”
In 1955, she opened a Bible institute in Malang, East Java. Several months  later, 
Margaret Brown joined her and thus began a successful partnership. In addition to 
the normal activities required in such schools, they supervised student church plant-
ing in the area. Spending almost forty years each in Bible school teaching and admin-
istration, they trained hundreds of pastors and church leaders and left their mark 
on the Indonesian Assemblies of God. When it was decided that a male national 
minister would direct the school, Brown and Dorff moved to a different region and

can be accomplished.” Three years later, however, as an American perceived to be a 
threat to a rebel cause, he was clubbed to death, his body taken fi  fty miles into the 
jungle, and thrown into the crocodile-infested Bomokandi River.
After the Belgian Congo was granted independence, civil war had broken out. 
Well aware of the risk involved, Jay and Angeline Tucker left the capital, Leopoldville 
(now Kinshasha), where it was safer, and returned with their children to the city of 
Paulis (now Isiro). Both had been hesitant about returning. But one night while still 
in the capital, Angeline had gone into the room where their children were sleeping.

[34] “Lord, what shall we do?” she prayed, “What about taking them into this area?” At 
that moment, she heard His answer: “I promise to deliver these children, not from, 
but out of the den of lions.” Angeline and Jay did not yet know that the rebels called 
themselves “simbas”—Swahili for “lions.” 
The rebel Simbas eventually took control of Paulis, placing the Tuckers and other 
Westerners under house arrest. Then the rebels took Jay into custody and held him, 
with other hostages, in a Catholic mission. Fearing an attack by American and Bel-
gian paratroopers, the insurgents hardened their attitudes toward the prisoners. 
Several days passed. Angeline had received no word about her husband. Finally she 
telephoned the mission to inquire about his welfare. In guarded words, “the Mother 
Superior . . . said, ‘Well, things are going along.’ I said, ‘How is my husband?’ She 
answered in French, ‘He is in heaven.’”

America and settled in Springfi  eld, Missouri. Angeline later served in the national 
Women’s Missionary Council (later, the Women’s Ministries Department).

[36] PEOPLE OF THE SPIRIT
The doctors said overwork caused his physical and mental breakdown in 1932, 
which required him to leave India. To this could be added the toll on his health taken 
by malaria. Without doubting the truthfulness of these explanations, he also knew 
“that God allowed me to pass through a nervous breakdown, and immediately after 
delivering me, illuminated my mind to picture and understand something of our 
Lord’s experiences in the garden, and their bearing on the nature of redemption’s 
victory.”
Like John of the Cross, a sixteenth-century mystic, Cummings began to expe-
rience the descent into the “dark night of the soul.” For the fi  rst three months, he 
seemed to lose all willpower and “became the prey of the most terribly vile and 
blasphemous evil powers. . . . Horrible and obscene suggestions and imaginations

[37] blasphemous evil powers. . . . Horrible and obscene suggestions and imaginations 
poured in an unceasing fl  ood through my consciousness.” Sleep became impossi-
ble without medication. Finally, “I felt as though I had been dragged through the 
sewers of hell.” All of the joys he had experienced in the Holy Spirit had now left 
him.
His worst fears were soon realized: The devil seemed to ask him, “Do you think, 
after the Lord has fi lled you once, and now that I have trapped you and fl ooded your 
soul with all this evil, that the Lord could ever cleanse you and take you back again?” 
Reluctantly, he agreed, believing that he had committed the unpardonable sin; all 
hope had vanished. In the words of John of the Cross, “The soul feels itself to be so 
impure and miserable that it believes God to be against it, and thinks that it has set 
itself up against God . . . that God has cast it away.”

[38] itself up against God . . . that God has cast it away.”
After two years of suffering, which included time spent in New York mental hos-
pitals, Cummings began to listen and internalize the Scripture promise pressed on 
him by several friends: “I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee” (Hebrews 13:5). For 
the fi  rst time in two years, on October 4, 1934, he fell to his knees and began to pray: 
“‘Lord,’ I said, ‘I am ashamed even to get into an attitude of prayer. I have been so 
resentful. My mind and heart and being have been so fi  lled with things which must be 
more repulsive to Thee than they are to me. I know now that there is no hope for me. 
I don’t believe you could ever take me back. But, Lord, I wonder if I could be wrong? 
You see in what terrible darkness and hopelessness every moment of my experience 
is spent. Lord, if there is anything you can do for me, won’t you do it? I would pray

[39] You see in what terrible darkness and hopelessness every moment of my experience 
is spent. Lord, if there is anything you can do for me, won’t you do it? I would pray 
if I could, but I can’t pray. There are no words to describe what I feel. Anyway, I don’t 
even feel. My heart is like a lump of stone.’”
He remembered that deep in his consciousness “a chorus began to sing.” It was 
line 2 of the song “In Jesus” that suddenly became illuminated with meaning. Written 
by James Procter, a former atheist who became a Christian, it reads:
My soul is night, my heart is steel;
I cannot see, I cannot feel;
For light, for life, I must appeal
In simple faith to Jesus.

[40] Then, “as the last word sang itself out in the silence of my heart, I knew HE stood 
with me. He gathered me in His arms and brought me into a place of nearness that 
I had never known before. His precious blood cleansed away all the stain and sin, all 
the feeling of evil, all the effect of that terrible experience. . . . The fetters snapped and 
I was free. O the unspeakable joy of that deliverance!”
Sometime later, while staying in New York City, Cummings rose early one morn-
ing. “While I was praying,” he recalled, “it seemed as though God took me by the hand 
into the garden of His agony, and showed me His Son there. My mind was astonished 
at what I saw. The Son of God appeared to be crushed. It seemed that He could not 
stand the horror of the thing that confronted Him.” Asking God what could have been 
in the cup that nearly overwhelmed Jesus, the Lord replied, “Do you not remember

[41] in the cup that nearly overwhelmed Jesus, the Lord replied, “Do you not remember 
the terror through which you passed during the fi  rst months of your nervous break-
down? Do you not remember calling out, ‘O God, it is impossible for me to endure 
another moment of this awful horror’? I was allowing you to taste a little, a very little, 
of the cup that My Son drank to its dregs, the cup of the world’s iniquity and sin.” 
In the early 1940s the Cummingses became affi  liated with the Assemblies of God 
and were invited to join the CBI faculty, Bob as director of missions and Mid as an 
instructor in English and Hindi. 
For the rest of his life and ministry, Cummings shared his insights into Christ’s 
sufferings in Gethsemane. Along with his uncommon discernment in the operation 
of the gifts of the Spirit in worship, his message of Christ as the sin-bearer for the 
redemption of lost humanity left a deep imprint on many Pentecostals, especially his 
students.

the use of musical instruments

continuing in the ministry; and the popular “I’m Going Higher,” after seeing an air-

youth services. The song leader would sometimes have the audience sing the chorus 
of the song seated, then standing, and fi  nally mounted on their chairs (on outings, 
they might stand on picnic tables).
Buffum’s compositions touched the chords of joy and sorrow in the Christian life 
and often reminded believers of their heavenly hope. In many ways, he shaped early 
twentieth-century evangelical and Pentecostal worship patterns. He had no formal 
training in music; nevertheless, his self-instruction and unusual ability enabled him 
to learn virtually any keyboard or stringed instrument.

[48] With enormous powers of concentration, Buffum could write songs (music and 
lyrics) during church services, in hotel lobbies, on trains, and in train stations, even 
while his four children climbed all over him. According to his daughter Lois, only 
one thing could throw off his concentration: singing another song. If no piano was 
available, Buffum would improvise on a table or another piece of furniture and tap 
out the song. He would even invite congregations to get into the act. First, he would 
have them suggest song titles. Writing the suggestions on a chalkboard, he would 
then have them vote on their top choice. Finally, he would compose a matching song 
on the spot.
In Huntington Beach, California, an eleven-year-old girl suggested the title 
“When I Take My Vacation in Heaven.” Although the congregation didn’t choose this 
one, Buffum was intrigued by it. By the next morning, he had composed the song.

[49] “When I Take My Vacation in Heaven.” Although the congregation didn’t choose this

Although he usually sold the rights to a song for fi  ve dollars—just enough for food 
and basic expenses—he sold this one for one hundred dollars; it became immensely 
popular, moving into the secular market.
The life and ministry of Herbert Buffum epitomizes the church’s troubadour, 
those who itinerated with the gospel in song. Their melodies and choruses not only 
enriched worship, they also infl  uenced day-to-day life, leaving a lyric in the heart that 
enabled the believer to maintain a walk of faith. Their legacy of music blessed gener-
ations of people in all walks of life in congregations around the world.

[1] young legal secretary suffering from severe physical and nervous exhaustion. Within 
days her friends marveled at how healthy she looked. Jones’s family had attended a 
Methodist church in Victoria, British Columbia, when Price arrived to hold an evan-
gelistic campaign. As a result, her family came into the Pentecostal movement. Her 
father, baptized in the Spirit during the meetings, felt called to the ministry. He later 
pastored and served as a district offi cial.
After her healing, Gwendoline (Gwen) Jones resigned her job and took up res-
idence in Seattle, where she enrolled at Northwest Bible Institute (now Northwest 
College). Her music training and editing of the college yearbook refl  ected the two 
great interests of her life: music and journalism. After graduation in 1939, she moved 
to Springfi  eld at the request of Noel Perkin, the missionary secretary, who had stayed 
in their home while preaching in her father’s church. “She came [to Springfi eld], and

departmental programs at headquarters as well as 
Council policies and doctrines. Few could fi  ll the 
bill better. In recognition of her accomplishments, 
the Evangelical Press Association elected her to its 
board of directors.
Over the years, Jones demonstrated the min-
istry that women could have in print media. She 
modeled effective leadership professionally and spiritually. “She demanded of herself 
the higher road of skills and effi  ciency; mediocrity was not in her vocabulary or behav-
ior,” remembers Projects Director Carol Ball. Women at the headquarters saw her as a 
mentor who enabled them to fi  nd their own way into productive ministry. “Observing 
Gwen, talking with her, seeking her counsel about routine questions,” added Ball, 
“helped me defi  ne the importance of my calling, the direction of my profession, and

work. Such was the case of Margaret J. Brown and Marcella

wife, Frances. After graduating from Northwest Bible Insti-
tute in Seattle, Wash ington (later Northwest College in Kirk-
land), Brown helped a classmate, Marie Dressler, in ministry 
in Idaho. A heart ailment, however, forced Brown’s return to 
Seattle. One night, struggling with her call to Indonesia, but 
aware that her heart condition disqualifi  ed her for appoint-
ment, she recommitted her life to Christ. “That night the Lord 
defi nitely healed me,” she wrote. “I  returned to the doctor 
who was astounded by my apparent good health!”
From the beginning of her ministry in Djakarta, Brown became involved in 
Bible school teaching. “A regular day’s work begins early,” she remembered, “usu-

friends and, at age sixteen, she dedicated her life to full-time ministry.
Ashcroft and his wife began to mentor Hammond and invited her to accompany 
them to Martinsburg, West Virginia, where he was scheduled to preach. By Pente-
costal standards, the services seemed dry and without demonstration of the power 
of God. Finally, before a Saturday evening service, he invited her to preach. While 
the congregation sang, Hammond desperately prayed to receive a message from the 
Lord. He “dropped into her heart” the verse, “O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched 
you, that ye should not obey the truth [?]” (Galatians 3:1, KJV). 
Stepping to the pulpit, she quoted the verse, paused momentarily, and then 
quoted it again. Without being able to launch into a sermon, she looked at the con-

ull-time ministry in the Assemblies of God has always appeared to be the 
domain of pastors, evangelists, and missionaries. On closer examination, the 
ministries of editors, writers, and educators have also been indispensable to the 
mission of the Church. Furthermore, whether working at the denominational head-
quarters in Springfi eld, Missouri, or teaching in colleges and seminaries, such people 
have played crucial parts in building the reputation for doctrinal stability that the 
General Council has enjoyed. 
Over the years, Gospel Publishing House (GPH) and the headquarters operation 
have been lightning rods for the criticism of those who mistrust the work of church 
bureaucracies. Editors, writers, managers, printers, artists, secretaries, mail clerks, 
and food servers don’t attain the kind of glamour that Pentecostals usually associate 
with power-packed ministry. Yet, such persons turn the wheels of church machinery

spent years writing and editing church publications to inspire and disciple the people 
in the pew and keep revival fi res burning.
The dedication required for their ministries 
compares favorably with that required of other 
endeavors in the General Council. Among those 
rarely in the limelight, Dorothy Morris and artist 
Norman Pearsall labored long in the preparation 
of Sunday School literature. (In a chapel service 
at Central Bible College, Pearsall once quipped, 
“God called me to preach until He heard me!” In 
any event, he became a gifted artist with a deep 
devotion to ministry.) Dorothy Kirschke, a sec-
retary in the music department, played a major 
part in the preparation of Hymns of Glorious Praise 
(1969), the fi  rst hymnal (rather than gospel song-
book like Melodies of Praise) produced by GPH.

Joyce Wells Booze, Janet Walker, and Beverly 
Graham placed the urgency of missions before 
the denomination by editing Mountain Movers, 
formerly the monthly missionary magazine of 
the Assemblies of God. Juleen Turnage ably represented the Assemblies of God to 
its public constituencies through her service as director of public relations, gaining 
widespread respect for her work during the televangelist scandals of the 1980s.
The roll call gets much longer for church publications when one adds faculty 
members in Assemblies of God schools, many of whom have enlarged the scope of 
their ministries by writing as well as teaching at overseas training schools during the 
summers.

faith, Missionettes training stretches from 
age three to the high school years: Rain-

We Called Him T.J.
T
he words of our little old professor’s prayer were 
always the same as, without warning, he bowed his 
snowy white head to commence class, “Open our eyes 
that we may behold wondrous things out of Thy Word and 
bless these precious students for Jesus’ sake. Amen.” As 
students at North Central Bible College there was no doubt 
in our minds that the Reverend T.J. Jones was deeply con-
cerned about our hearts, our minds, and our ministry to a 
lost and dying world. 
We students who were reared in Sunday school con-
sidered the ﬁ rst ﬁ ve books of the Holy Bible, known as 
the Pentateuch, to be extremely boring and nonessential. 
Most of us were completely unfamiliar with its content, except for a few action-packed 
stories. Our feelings about the Old Testament, and the Pentateuch in particular, soon 
began to change as this advanced student of the Word made these books come alive.

[12] stories. Our feelings about the Old Testament, and the Pentateuch in particular, soon 
began to change as this advanced student of the Word made these books come alive. 
Nothing was omitted as T.J. read aloud every single verse, explaining each term 
and deﬁ  ning various individual words. A big, black Bible was always at his side, but he 
much preferred reading from small, separate paperback books of the Bible. They were 
much easier for him to hold close to his face as he sat on a high stool with both arms 
resting on the lectern. 
Fifty years of strenuous preaching had greatly taxed the voice of our lovable 
instructor. It wasn’t exactly melodious as he spoke into the small microphone clipped 
to his lapel. But, oh, the truths that came forth from that scholar of the Word! We con-
sidered him a scholar because he could tell us what was in every chapter of the Bible 
and could quote most of it, too. But T.J. thought of himself as “just a student” of God’s 
precious Word.

and could quote most of it, too. But T.J. thought of himself as “just a student” of God’s 
precious Word. 
Our predecessors frequently tried to tell us that we should have heard T.J. Jones 20 
years ago or more when he was really ﬁ  ery and full of life. Our retort was simply, “T.J. 
knows more now.” We reasoned that a man would have to be wiser after studying the 
Bible every day for that many additional years. Besides, his brilliant mind was still as 
sharp as a tack. 
The quaint old gentleman, who knew what he was talking about, often interspersed 
nuggets of personal wisdom in his teaching of the Scriptures. Since “One hamburger 
was cheaper than two,” he didn’t marry until after he had pioneered a few churches. 
Continually T.J. encouraged the young men to get their books ﬁ  rst, then their Buick, and 
last of all their bride. Some advice was hard to follow.

T.J. wasn’t able to move about as he wanted to when he became excited, but that 
didn’t keep him from dramatizing Moses’ reply to Pharaoh, “Not a hoof shall be left 
behind!” Not even Leviticus was dry after T. J. Jones got done with it. His words held 
true, “The drier the book, the more it burns.” 
The complex study of Daniel and Revelation was diﬃ   cult for most of us, and even 
after weeks in the class many things weren’t clear in our minds. Often T.J. asked a diﬃ  cult 
question and no one was able to answer. His expression would change to one of despair

as he asked, “Have I been with you so long and still you do not know?” After a lengthy 
pause he would begin to go through the material until our minds were enlightened. 
The Jones’ course in typology was considerably less diﬃ   cult with the aid of a com-
plete full-scale model of the tabernacle in front of the class. Sometimes he would get 
so thrilled while teaching that he’d start to sing. An original song of his was about going 
through the courtyard and Holy Place and into the Holy of Holies. His creaky singing 
was thoroughly enjoyed by all of us, but he would stop abruptly and blurt out, “You 
don’t want to hear me sing.” Not too many days passed, though, until he’d get the urge 
to sing for us again.

T. J. Jones lived to preach and teach God’s Holy Word. He always came to class with 
an armful of books, including a notebook stuffed full with notes sticking out each side 
of it. His organization was such that only he could ﬁ  gure it out. When reading from one 
page fastened in the notebook, he would suddenly pull out a slip of paper from another 
part. Scribbled on it would be a continuation of what he was reading or an augmen-
tation to it. When he ﬁ nished with the piece he would jam it back in somewhere—or 
anywhere—who knows? 
A “scrap” he pulled out one day was an old tattered Christmas church bulletin on 
which he had jotted some valuable notes. How he could ﬁ  gure out such a seemingly 
disorganized system was amazing to us. 
Never was Brother Jones to be interrupted while teaching. When such an event hap-

[17] Never was Brother Jones to be interrupted while teaching. When such an event hap-
pened, it was evident he was not pleased. Whenever a fellow walked into class late, T.J. 
would stop immediately and begin to question, “Young man, was your tea too hot or 
are you trying to impress the girls?” If T. J. then gave his unmistakable giggle with three 
ﬁ ngers raised in front of his mouth, we knew everything was all right. But that wasn’t 
always the case. Whenever he was late, though, he blamed it on the slow elevator. 
Heartfelt concern for students marked the ministry of T. J. Jones at North Central 
Bible College. Besides increasing our head knowledge of God’s Word, he daily encour-
aged us to hide it in our hearts that we might not sin against God. It was also this great 
man’s joy to bear students’ burdens whenever he was asked to pray in chapel. After

[18] man’s joy to bear students’ burdens whenever he was asked to pray in chapel. After 
reading the requests, he would place the cards in his hands and raise them high as he 
poured out his soul to the Lord. Prayers were answered. 
Occasionally he spoke about getting old and assured us that the song “Beautiful 
Isle of Somewhere” was deﬁ  nitely not going to be heard at his funeral. In a determined 
voice he explained that he was not going to a beautiful isle somewhere, but he was 
going to heaven to see his Jesus! 
On July 17, 1970, Jesus Christ became T.J.’s joy of heaven and no longer his hope 
of earth. Sure enough, not a strain of “Beautiful Isle of Somewhere” was heard at that 
glorious funeral. Instead the air was ﬁ  lled with the melodies of his favorite songs: “All 
the Way My Saviour Leads Me,” “God Will Take Care of You,” “Face to Face,” and “Jesus 
Led Me All the Way.” 
We surely miss Rev. Thomas James Jones, but we know heaven is happier with the 
presence of such a saint.

[20] Before his departure, Perkin had recommended that he read two books by Roland 
Allen, Missionary Methods: St. Paul’s or Ours? (1912) and The Spontaneous Expansion of the 
Church and the Causes Which Hinder It (1927). Hodges’s assignment to work with Ralph D. 
Williams, an understudy of Alice E. Luce, afforded him the opportunity to learn fi rst-
hand within a context already being fashioned by the teachings of Allen. Eventually, 
El Salvador became a showcase of church planting. 
After ten months there, Melvin and Lois and their family moved to Matagalpa, 
Nicaragua. They traveled extensively to survey the churches, often living in primitive 
conditions. Convinced that training would best equip national ministers to reach 
their own people, he founded a Bible institute in Matagalpa. Those who enrolled 
were required to combine their studies with evangelism and church planting.

[21] were required to combine their studies with evangelism and church planting.
After Hodges’s arrival in Central America, his penchant for writing became evi-
dent: A steady stream of letters and reports fl  owed from his pen to church publica-
tions. Using a simple style, he wrote in English and Spanish to the common person.
At the close of their second term in 1944, the Hodgeses returned to the United 
States physically exhausted. He accepted an invitation to the headquarters in Spring-
fi eld, Missouri, and worked for fi  ve years as editor of mission publications. In 1948, he 
became the founding editor of Missionary Forum, an in-house publication for missionary 
personnel. Using this as his pulpit, Hodges heralded the values of building self-sup-
porting churches. In this, he joined with the missionary secretary, Noel Perkin, who 
cautioned the missionaries about the growing expenses of maintaining and enlarging

[22] porting churches. In this, he joined with the missionary secretary, Noel Perkin, who 
cautioned the missionaries about the growing expenses of maintaining and enlarging 
the many orphanages and charitable institutions they supported. Perkin reasoned that 
“the material and physical need of the people in many lands is relatively unlimited, so 
that all available missionary funds could readily be absorbed in such work.” Still, he 
credited the home constituency with a continuing interest in the needy, observing that 
fi nancial appeals from these efforts consistently gained responses when others failed. 
For Hodges and Perkin, both of whom deeply cared about suffering people, charitable 
ministries represented by-products of evangelism, not primary means to that end.
Yet it is fair to say that mission leaders sometimes misjudged the value of chari-
table institutions in countries like Egypt and India for training church leaders. In Ted

[23] Yet it is fair to say that mission leaders sometimes misjudged the value of chari-
table institutions in countries like Egypt and India for training church leaders. In Ted 
and Estelle Vassar’s orphanage in South India, young men who desired to enter the 
ministry were encouraged to “learn a trade along with their Bible training. They were 
admonished not to rely solely on the Western Church for their support. From child-
hood, the orphans had chores for which they received an allowance and they were 
taught to tithe.” Notable Indian church leaders emerged from this institution with an 
abiding appreciation for their tutelage.
In 1951, the Foreign Missions Department invited Hodges to address a special 
gathering of missionaries. His lectures formed the basis for what would become his 
best-known book, The Indigenous Church, published two years later. Noting one of the 
key ingredients for Pentecostal church growth, he declared, “The faith which Pente-

and unlearned,’ has raised up a host of lay preachers and leaders of unusual spiritual 
ability—not unlike the rugged fi  shermen who fi  rst followed the Lord.” 
After a third term in Central America, Hodges again returned to Springfi  eld, 
this time to become fi  eld secretary for Latin America and the West Indies. He began 
his job by overseeing the activities of nearly two hundred missionaries, planning 
strategy, and developing specialized ministries in radio, literature, and ministerial 
training. Over the years he and other leaders retrained the entire missionary force in 
understanding the nature of indigenous church principles and how to apply them. 
Not surprisingly, this changed the relationship of missionaries with national church 
leaders from one of paternal control to partnership.

[26] At the same time, charitable institutions continued and new ones developed; 
gradually the Assemblies of God developed a holistic theology of mission. In this 
respect, the practice of its mission program has been a pilgrimage: a long-standing 
resolve to be true to the Great Commission, along with a search to understand its 
implications for caring for the impoverished and despised.
Hodges contributed to the education of thousands of missionaries (both Pente-
costal and non-Pentecostal), who in turn prepared many more thousands of pastors, 
evangelists, and church workers. In addition, he became the leading Pentecostal mis-
siologist and the fi  rst to be published outside of denominational publications; his 
public became worldwide.
At sixty-four years of age and after twenty years’ service as fi  eld secretary, he

Marcella Dorff grew up in Fargo, North Dakota, and 
enrolled at North Central Bible College in Minneapolis, Min-
nesota. From the time of her conversion, she heard the call to 
missions. While still in Fargo, she had a vision while in prayer 
and saw “brown skinned people coming down a mountain to 
hear the Word and they were so happy.” At North Central her 
interest grew, but she hesitated to tell anyone lest her dream 
not come true. She asked the Lord to give her a sign by hav-
ing someone else confi  rm the call to her.
During her junior year, the Lord impressed on her the 
spiritual needs of Indonesia. Reminding Him of her request, 
she suddenly remembered the fate of Zechariah, father of John the Baptist, who also 
demanded a sign (Luke 1:18–20). “Icy chills ran down my back,” she remembered, “and

a fl  ash it was made plain what God was trying to show me and I  said ‘Yes, [that] 
I believed it was God’s will and I would tell others about my call.’”
Finishing her studies, Dorff went to Owatonna, Min nesota, and spent fi ve years 
pioneering an Assemblies of God church. Lessons of faith learned there prepared her 
for the mission fi  eld. On one occasion she asked a real estate agent to help her fi nd 
a new place of worship with only ten dollars “between [me] and the church.” A house 
was purchased, and nine months later so were several lots for the construction of a 
church building—“God helped us to meet every payment.”

Dorff departed for Indonesia in December 1952. Visiting Gambangwaluh in a 
remote area sometime later, she saw people walking down mountain paths to attend 
the church there. Observing this, she said, “I was reminded of what I had seen when 
I was fi rst saved.”
In 1955, she opened a Bible institute in Malang, East Java. Several months  later, 
Margaret Brown joined her and thus began a successful partnership. In addition to 
the normal activities required in such schools, they supervised student church plant-
ing in the area. Spending almost forty years each in Bible school teaching and admin-
istration, they trained hundreds of pastors and church leaders and left their mark 
on the Indonesian Assemblies of God. When it was decided that a male national

[33] my fi  rst contact with The Congo in 1939 have I had reason to be more hopeful for what 
can be accomplished.” Three years later, however, as an American perceived to be a 
threat to a rebel cause, he was clubbed to death, his body taken fi  fty miles into the 
jungle, and thrown into the crocodile-infested Bomokandi River.
After the Belgian Congo was granted independence, civil war had broken out. 
Well aware of the risk involved, Jay and Angeline Tucker left the capital, Leopoldville 
(now Kinshasha), where it was safer, and returned with their children to the city of 
Paulis (now Isiro). Both had been hesitant about returning. But one night while still 
in the capital, Angeline had gone into the room where their children were sleeping. 
“Lord, what shall we do?” she prayed, “What about taking them into this area?” At

[34] “Lord, what shall we do?” she prayed, “What about taking them into this area?” At 
that moment, she heard His answer: “I promise to deliver these children, not from, 
but out of the den of lions.” Angeline and Jay did not yet know that the rebels called 
themselves “simbas”—Swahili for “lions.” 
The rebel Simbas eventually took control of Paulis, placing the Tuckers and other 
Westerners under house arrest. Then the rebels took Jay into custody and held him, 
with other hostages, in a Catholic mission. Fearing an attack by American and Bel-
gian paratroopers, the insurgents hardened their attitudes toward the prisoners. 
Several days passed. Angeline had received no word about her husband. Finally she 
telephoned the mission to inquire about his welfare. In guarded words, “the Mother 
Superior . . . said, ‘Well, things are going along.’ I said, ‘How is my husband?’ She 
answered in French, ‘He is in heaven.’”

America and settled in Springfi  eld, Missouri. Angeline later served in the national 
Women’s Missionary Council (later, the Women’s Ministries Department).

The doctors said overwork caused his physical and mental breakdown in 1932, 
which required him to leave India. To this could be added the toll on his health taken 
by malaria. Without doubting the truthfulness of these explanations, he also knew 
“that God allowed me to pass through a nervous breakdown, and immediately after 
delivering me, illuminated my mind to picture and understand something of our 
Lord’s experiences in the garden, and their bearing on the nature of redemption’s 
victory.”
Like John of the Cross, a sixteenth-century mystic, Cummings began to expe-
rience the descent into the “dark night of the soul.” For the fi  rst three months, he 
seemed to lose all willpower and “became the prey of the most terribly vile and 
blasphemous evil powers. . . . Horrible and obscene suggestions and imaginations

[37] blasphemous evil powers. . . . Horrible and obscene suggestions and imaginations 
poured in an unceasing fl  ood through my consciousness.” Sleep became impossi-
ble without medication. Finally, “I felt as though I had been dragged through the 
sewers of hell.” All of the joys he had experienced in the Holy Spirit had now left 
him.
His worst fears were soon realized: The devil seemed to ask him, “Do you think, 
after the Lord has fi lled you once, and now that I have trapped you and fl ooded your 
soul with all this evil, that the Lord could ever cleanse you and take you back again?” 
Reluctantly, he agreed, believing that he had committed the unpardonable sin; all 
hope had vanished. In the words of John of the Cross, “The soul feels itself to be so 
impure and miserable that it believes God to be against it, and thinks that it has set 
itself up against God . . . that God has cast it away.”
After two years of suffering, which included time spent in New York mental hos-

[38] itself up against God . . . that God has cast it away.”
After two years of suffering, which included time spent in New York mental hos-
pitals, Cummings began to listen and internalize the Scripture promise pressed on 
him by several friends: “I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee” (Hebrews 13:5). For 
the fi  rst time in two years, on October 4, 1934, he fell to his knees and began to pray: 
“‘Lord,’ I said, ‘I am ashamed even to get into an attitude of prayer. I have been so 
resentful. My mind and heart and being have been so fi  lled with things which must be 
more repulsive to Thee than they are to me. I know now that there is no hope for me. 
I don’t believe you could ever take me back. But, Lord, I wonder if I could be wrong? 
You see in what terrible darkness and hopelessness every moment of my experience 
is spent. Lord, if there is anything you can do for me, won’t you do it? I would pray

[39] You see in what terrible darkness and hopelessness every moment of my experience 
is spent. Lord, if there is anything you can do for me, won’t you do it? I would pray 
if I could, but I can’t pray. There are no words to describe what I feel. Anyway, I don’t 
even feel. My heart is like a lump of stone.’”
He remembered that deep in his consciousness “a chorus began to sing.” It was 
line 2 of the song “In Jesus” that suddenly became illuminated with meaning. Written 
by James Procter, a former atheist who became a Christian, it reads:
My soul is night, my heart is steel;
I cannot see, I cannot feel;
For light, for life, I must appeal
In simple faith to Jesus.

[40] Then, “as the last word sang itself out in the silence of my heart, I knew HE stood 
with me. He gathered me in His arms and brought me into a place of nearness that 
I had never known before. His precious blood cleansed away all the stain and sin, all

Sometime later, while staying in New York City, Cummings rose early one morn-
ing. “While I was praying,” he recalled, “it seemed as though God took me by the hand 
into the garden of His agony, and showed me His Son there. My mind was astonished 
at what I saw. The Son of God appeared to be crushed. It seemed that He could not 
stand the horror of the thing that confronted Him.” Asking God what could have been

[41] in the cup that nearly overwhelmed Jesus, the Lord replied, “Do you not remember 
the terror through which you passed during the fi  rst months of your nervous break-
down? Do you not remember calling out, ‘O God, it is impossible for me to endure 
another moment of this awful horror’? I was allowing you to taste a little, a very little, 
of the cup that My Son drank to its dregs, the cup of the world’s iniquity and sin.” 
In the early 1940s the Cummingses became affi  liated with the Assemblies of God 
and were invited to join the CBI faculty, Bob as director of missions and Mid as an 
instructor in English and Hindi. 
For the rest of his life and ministry, Cummings shared his insights into Christ’s 
sufferings in Gethsemane. Along with his uncommon discernment in the operation 
of the gifts of the Spirit in worship, his message of Christ as the sin-bearer for the 
redemption of lost humanity left a deep imprint on many Pentecostals, especially his 
students.

continuing in the ministry; and the popular “I’m Going Higher,” after seeing an air-
plane overhead (an uncommon sight in 1923). This last song became popular in 
youth services. The song leader would sometimes have the audience sing the chorus 
of the song seated, then standing, and fi  nally mounted on their chairs (on outings, 
they might stand on picnic tables).
Buffum’s compositions touched the chords of joy and sorrow in the Christian life 
and often reminded believers of their heavenly hope. In many ways, he shaped early 
twentieth-century evangelical and Pentecostal worship patterns. He had no formal 
training in music; nevertheless, his self-instruction and unusual ability enabled him 
to learn virtually any keyboard or stringed instrument.
With enormous powers of concentration, Buffum could write songs (music and

[48] With enormous powers of concentration, Buffum could write songs (music and 
lyrics) during church services, in hotel lobbies, on trains, and in train stations, even 
while his four children climbed all over him. According to his daughter Lois, only 
one thing could throw off his concentration: singing another song. If no piano was 
available, Buffum would improvise on a table or another piece of furniture and tap 
out the song. He would even invite congregations to get into the act. First, he would 
have them suggest song titles. Writing the suggestions on a chalkboard, he would 
then have them vote on their top choice. Finally, he would compose a matching song 
on the spot.
In Huntington Beach, California, an eleven-year-old girl suggested the title 
“When I Take My Vacation in Heaven.” Although the congregation didn’t choose this 
one, Buffum was intrigued by it. By the next morning, he had composed the song.

[49] “When I Take My Vacation in Heaven.” Although the congregation didn’t choose this

Although he usually sold the rights to a song for fi  ve dollars—just enough for food 
and basic expenses—he sold this one for one hundred dollars; it became immensely 
popular, moving into the secular market.
The life and ministry of Herbert Buffum epitomizes the church’s troubadour, 
those who itinerated with the gospel in song. Their melodies and choruses not only 
enriched worship, they also infl  uenced day-to-day life, leaving a lyric in the heart that 
enabled the believer to maintain a walk of faith. Their legacy of music blessed gener-
ations of people in all walks of life in congregations around the world.

[51] time with the Assemblies of God as an evangelist (1919–1922). Her stature became 
such in the denomination that at the 1920 General Council meeting in Springfi  eld, 
Missouri, Sister preached in four evening services and held an afternoon healing ser-
vice. In so doing, she became one of the few women to preach at a Council and the 
only one in the denomination’s history to ever speak in more than one service. 
Yet McPherson refused to limit her ministry to a single constituency. She boldly 
carried her “foursquare gospel” (a creative adaptation of the terms fourfold gospel 
and full gospel: Jesus as Savior, Healer, Baptizer, and coming King) wherever she 
went, to “red and yellow, black and white,” as well as rich or poor.
What made her ministry so effective? There were many reasons. People fl  ocked 
to her services around the country because they needed healing or simply went with 
friends and relatives who did. Preaching the great “I  Am,” she struck a responsive

[52] Foursquare Church and the Assemblies of God. 
Whether she was preaching and praying for the sick in Denver, Wichita, San Jose, 
Baltimore, Philadelphia, Rochester, Tampa, or Toronto, revival followed. The impact 
of her campaigns also jump-started many struggling little Pentecostal churches. 
Her journey “From Milkpail to Pulpit”—with its drama and pathos, its triumphs 
and failures, its laughter and tears—held her listeners at the edge of their seats 
because it resembled their stories too, or at least one they wished for themselves. 
But while she inspired their imaginations, she couldn’t share the rest of her story. 
At times, McPherson’s public persona masked a painful loneliness. In 1911, 
a year after returning from China, she married divorcé Harold McPherson, who 
appeared to offer her the security she needed. Two years later, she gave birth to 
their son, Rolf. Domesticity, however, soon frustrated her intense burden for evan-

[53] by the world famous Pandita Ramabai, a high-caste Hindu convert to Christianity, 
the mission housed hundreds of widows and orphans and provided relief to famine 
victims. Called the “George Müller of India” because of her faith in God and her char-
itable ministries, Ramabai needed help in administering the operation and quickly 
accepted Abrams’s offer. 
Infl uenced by the higher life teachings of the Keswick conferences in England, Ram-
abai, along with other Christians, prayed for the outpouring of the Spirit. In this, she 
was joined by Abrams, whose views on the sanctifi  ed life refl  ected a distinctly Wesleyan 
orientation. After word reached India in 1904 telling of the revival in Wales, revival broke 
out the next year at mission stations in the Khassia Hills of northeast India staffed by 
Welsh Presbyterian missionaries. Believers there began intensely confessing their sins

try. “People who are poor, sick, and hungry need more than money, health, and food,” 
she wrote in 1990. “Like us all, they need meaning in life—a sense of order, a reason 
for living. This is where Christians have so much to offer. If you help people fi nd the 
meaning of life while helping them fi nd a home or get a job, you are helping them at 
the deepest level.”
ROBERT E. COOLEY 
(1930–)
A number of Assemblies of God scholars like Billie Davis 
have made signifi  cant academic contributions. To the hall of 
fame must be added the name of Robert E. Cooley. He was 
born into a pastor’s home in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and his 
father later served as Michigan district superintendent. In 
1952, he married Eilene Carlson and received ordination from 
the Michigan district six years later.
Academic training for the ministry took him from Central

[2] Educators presented in this chapter include Peter C. Nelson, Myer Pearlman, 
Marcus L. Grable, Christine Gibson, and Stanley H. Frodsham. Gibson, founder of 
the independent Zion Bible Institute in Rhode Island, never held credentials with the 
General Council. Yet hundreds of Assemblies of God ministers received their training 
there; her story deserves to be told. Stanley H. Frodsham, long-time editor of the 
Pentecostal Evangel, has also been included. While he did some teaching at CBI, his 
contributions lie in his editorial work and many books. Through these means, he 
contributed to ministerial preparation formally and informally. Many who couldn’t 
attend the Bible institutes depended on the Evangel for instruction, sermon ideas, 
and Sunday School lessons.
PETER C. NELSON
(1868–1942)
Generally, Pentecostals looked down on academic degrees as more of a hindrance 
than help for Spirit-fi  lled ministry. For example, one early Council leader recalled,

[3] buildings: churches, post offi  ces, government offi  ces, libraries, schools. Since they 
were free and open to the public, each one made a profound impact on her life. Hav-
ing gotten permission from her mother to attend a Sunday School class, Davis heard 
the teacher say that Jesus loved her. Now she had not only sat on a chair for the fi rst 
time, she had found hope. “It was the fi  rst time I saw a way out of the fatalism of 
the campgrounds,” she refl  ected. “The rich get richer, the poor get poorer, everybody 
pushes you down, you don’t have a chance. But in Sunday School they said you did
have a chance, because you’re a child of God.”
Libraries opened a whole new world for her, and the public school promised 
her the same education that every other child received. After Davis’s family settled 
down during World War II, she graduated from high school as the valedictorian of her 
class and began working at an aircraft factory in San Diego. Having edited her high

school paper, she dreamed of becoming a journalist and wrote to the national Sun-
day School Department in Springfi  eld. Learning of her interest in writing and editing, 
Marcus Grable invited her to assist with the new Sunday School Counselor magazine.
Only nineteen and having a single change of clothes, she arrived in Springfi eld in 
the early 1940s to collect sixteen dollars a week at headquarters. Giving up plans to

Drury College (now University). It was during this time that she met George Davis, a

They went to Costa Rica as missionaries in 1957 and eventually were assigned to pro-

Years later, Davis graduated with highest honors from Drury and capped her

Cooley’s inauguration as president of Gordon-Conwell Theo-
logical Seminary in 1981 marked a milestone in North American 
Pentecostalism. “‘Historic’ . . . seemed a tame term,” mused Rus-

which had begun in 1942 with membership in the National Asso-

Miranda grew up in an unpromising environment: a poor barrio in Albuquerque, 
New Mexico, one of fi ve children born to a sawmill worker who had emigrated from 
Chihuahua State in Mexico and a mother of Spanish descent. He came to Christ at 
an early age after members of a nearby Pentecostal church, who had heard that his 
mother was sick, came to the house and prayed for her. Her healing had a dramatic 
effect on the family and young Jesse. 
The church had been in contact with the family for two years before the healing. 
“This little Pentecostal church would come in an old broken-down-bus, pick us up, 
and take me to church—that made the difference,” Miranda recalled. It was at church 
that he learned to write. At Christmastime, when his parents gave clothes as presents

as an example: Joe E. Martinez, an Assemblies of God layman and professor at the 
University of New Mexico. “That’s the image that stuck.”

[15] His parents—a Catholic father and mainline Protestant mother—also mentored 
him in the importance of reconciliation. “I remember I was 13 or 14, and I said, ‘Dad, 
Catholics never read the Bible,’ because I never saw him read it. ‘Mother, you read the 
Bible but never come to the book of Acts.’ And then they would turn around and say, 
‘And you Pentecostals never leave the Book of Acts.’ So I saw my shortcomings and 
I saw differences. Yet we loved and respected one another so that we really enjoyed 
our fellowship. And we all affi  rmed one another.” 
At age sixteen, he began to attend Bible school, and his pastor assigned him 
preaching responsibilities a year later. Like other young people who demonstrated

n late summer 1930, William I. Evans, the “principal” of Central Bible Institute 
(CBI) announced that the school year would begin on September 26, and there 
was still room for more students. “We are looking for Jesus to come and, in conse-
quence of that glorious event, we may never conduct the [term],” he remarked. “We 
thank God for the blessed hope. . . . However, we are occupying till He comes. That 
occupation with us is making this Institute count for the very most in the advance-
ment of the Kingdom.” The school preferred mature and “diligent students of the 
Word,” nineteen years of age and older. Accepting applicants below this age might 
mean that at graduation three years later, they could still be “too young to be trusted 
with the responsibilities involved.”

[20] Evans lamented that fi  nding students with the “highest type of consecration 
among us is getting rarer.” Life at a Bible institute contrasted sharply with campus 
life at colleges and universities. Preeminently an experience in spiritual formation, it 
demanded a high level of dedication to stay the course.
The “standards of holiness” required separation from worldly values. “It grieves 
our hearts and we could weep,” he added in disappointment, “when we see world 
conformity among Bible school graduates!” Women especially seem to have been 
the culprits: “We have seen pastors’ wives and lady pastors and leaders dressed so 
much like the world as to show no line of separation.” Hence, “short skirts, low necks, 
sheer clothes, adornments, and worldly style of hair dress, are inexcusable. Certainly 
religion does not consist in what we wear, but genuine religion of the kind we profess

[21] religion does not consist in what we wear, but genuine religion of the kind we profess 
will show itself in these matters.” Hopefully, “only . . . serious-minded youths will 
care to apply themselves to [the school’s] rigor.” 
Although strict discipline characterized all the schools, the atmosphere could 
hardly be described as dull or without humor. Instead, both students and faculty 
members shared a common commitment for the evangelization of the world. Refl ect-
ing the desire of church leaders and grassroots believers alike, Evans pleaded, “We 
want all its facilities from walls and roof to the services of consecrated instructors to 
produce the very utmost in lives for the Kingdom.”

[22] PEOPLE OF THE SPIRIT
Alumni from Assemblies of God schools often recall classroom instructors who 
profoundly impacted their lives. Since these institutions were ventures of faith, fac-
ulty members worked long hours, struggled with low pay, and frequently received lit-
tle recognition for their sacrifi cial efforts. In a report published in the Pentecostal Evan-
gel about the 1937 commencement at Latin American Bible Institute in San Antonio 
and the thirty-fi  ve men and women who graduated, the writer attributed the success 
of the school to the sacrifi  ces of the staff: “Much credit is due to Brother Ball and the 
group of workers who have been assisting him as teachers in the school, since funds 
have never been very plentiful so as to enable anyone to be really remunerated for 
his services; but each has given his time and effort willingly as unto the Lord, trusting 
God for the supply of his individual needs.”

[23] his services; but each has given his time and effort willingly as unto the Lord, trusting 
God for the supply of his individual needs.”
Most churches did not fi  nancially support these schools for several reasons: 
First, they sometimes preferred spending their monies on local church ministries 
and/or foreign missions. Second, a long-standing fear of educational preparation 
made many wary of Bible institutes. Third, since the schools operated on faith, God 
would somehow provide for them; indeed, strong fi  nancial backing might jeopardize 
their spiritual vigor. Despite the handicaps that worked against their effectiveness, 
teachers contributed heavily to the spiritual formation of thousands of pastors, evan-
gelists, missionaries, and other church workers.

several states of this country, young men and women will gather in for another year 
of study and training for the ministry among their own Spanish-speaking people. Year

condition at the homes of the students will prevent many of them from coming to school

As we bring this urgent need before our Evangel readers, we trust the Lord will 
lay it upon some hearts to help, for we believe that funds invested in the school will 
yield good dividends in the Kingdom of God. Offerings may be sent to the Foreign Mis-

Bryant’s infl  uence. Enrolling at a Baptist seminary in the Chicago area a year later, he 
found that without an undergraduate degree he was not prepared, so he switched to 
Denison University in Ohio. To cover his expenses, he worked as a manual laborer. 
While there he met his wife, Myrtle Garmong, who then helped him complete the 
program (in seven years).
Still feeling unprepared, he enrolled at Rochester Seminary in 1899. Augustus 
H. Strong, the president and professor of theology, taught the courses in systematic 
theology, and Nelson became one of his students. Strong’s Systematic Theology, fi  rst 
published in 1886, had gone through seven editions and reached nearly twelve hun-
dred pages by the time he got there. “I have discarded none of the Baptist  doctrines,” 
he reminisced many years later, “but have built a story or two on the good solid foun-

[28] he reminisced many years later, “but have built a story or two on the good solid foun-

Following graduation, he evangelized and pastored several churches before 
being called to pastor Conley Memorial Baptist Church in Detroit. His contact with 
Pentecostals began in 1920, but they failed to impress him. Nevertheless, a healing 
from a serious and possibly life-threatening infection led him to begin preaching on 
divine healing. But the congregation refused to accept this new teaching, and before 
long he resigned. Shortly after, he was baptized in the Spirit and joined the Assem-
blies of God. 
By now over fi  fty years old and a seasoned minister, he detected that many young 
people in the Assemblies of God were entering the ministry just like he had: with little 
preparation. In 1927 he moved to Enid, Oklahoma, where he founded a church and

MYER PEARLMAN
(1898–1943)
The personalities in this chapter came from widely different backgrounds, and 
Myer Pearlman was no exception. The eldest son of a 
Jewish family, he studied at a synagogue school in Bir-
mingham, England. In school he remembered learning 
the Jewish version of the three R’s: the Jewish faith, the 
Torah (Old Testament), and the Hebrew language. “I was 
taught,” he recalled, “that while I  was to be a patriotic 
Englishman, I was also a Jew, a member of the nation, and 
that I was different from other people. I remember passing 
meat markets, and inwardly thanking God that I did not 
eat unclean meat.”
The economic situation in England forced his  father 
to move the family to the United States in hopes of gain-

[32] meat markets, and inwardly thanking God that I did not 
eat unclean meat.”
The economic situation in England forced his  father 
to move the family to the United States in hopes of gain-
ing employment and improving their living standard. After settling in New York City in 
1915, the younger Pearlman eventually enlisted in the U.S. Army and served eighteen 
months in the medical corps in France. His profi ciency in French helped him in this 
capacity. After the war, he traveled to California where “groping for light I began to 
read religious books and attend services.” 
Sometime later, walking by a mission in San Francisco, he noticed a crowd gath-
ered at the entrance and stopped to listen to the music. On another evening, he 
stood outside again. Mustering his courage, he entered and took a seat. He was par-
ticularly impressed by the music, especially the song “Honey in the Rock,” written by 
F.A. Graves. Based on Deuteronomy 32:13 (“he nourished [Israel] with honey from

[33] ticularly impressed by the music, especially the song “Honey in the Rock,” written by 
F.A. Graves. Based on Deuteronomy 32:13 (“he nourished [Israel] with honey from 
the rock”), it tells of God’s grace and provision from an unexpected source. Verse two 
asks, “Have you ‘tasted that the Lord is gracious?’ Do you walk in the way that’s new? 
Have you drunk from the living fountain? There’s Honey in the Rock [Jesus Christ] 
for you.” Attending nightly, he eventually confessed his sins and became a Christian, 
praying “in the name of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.”
In 1922, Pearlman enrolled at Central Bible Institute, where he later met 
his wife, Irene Graves, daughter of the songwriter. A brilliant student and self-
taught in many areas, he read the Scriptures in Hebrew, Greek, Spanish, French, 
and Italian. At graduation time, the principal, Frank M. Boyd, invited him to join 
the faculty. Pearlman accepted and taught there from 1924 until his death in 1943.

try. “People who are poor, sick, and hungry need more than money, health, and food,” 
she wrote in 1990. “Like us all, they need meaning in life—a sense of order, a reason 
for living. This is where Christians have so much to offer. If you help people fi nd the

ROBERT E. COOLEY 
(1930–)
A number of Assemblies of God scholars like Billie Davis 
have made signifi  cant academic contributions. To the hall of 
fame must be added the name of Robert E. Cooley. He was 
born into a pastor’s home in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and his 
father later served as Michigan district superintendent. In 
1952, he married Eilene Carlson and received ordination from 
the Michigan district six years later.
Academic training for the ministry took him from Central

[2] Educators presented in this chapter include Peter C. Nelson, Myer Pearlman, 
Marcus L. Grable, Christine Gibson, and Stanley H. Frodsham. Gibson, founder of 
the independent Zion Bible Institute in Rhode Island, never held credentials with the 
General Council. Yet hundreds of Assemblies of God ministers received their training 
there; her story deserves to be told. Stanley H. Frodsham, long-time editor of the 
Pentecostal Evangel, has also been included. While he did some teaching at CBI, his 
contributions lie in his editorial work and many books. Through these means, he 
contributed to ministerial preparation formally and informally. Many who couldn’t 
attend the Bible institutes depended on the Evangel for instruction, sermon ideas, 
and Sunday School lessons.
PETER C. NELSON
(1868–1942)
Generally, Pentecostals looked down on academic degrees as more of a hindrance 
than help for Spirit-fi  lled ministry. For example, one early Council leader recalled,

[3] buildings: churches, post offi  ces, government offi  ces, libraries, schools. Since they 
were free and open to the public, each one made a profound impact on her life. Hav-
ing gotten permission from her mother to attend a Sunday School class, Davis heard 
the teacher say that Jesus loved her. Now she had not only sat on a chair for the fi rst 
time, she had found hope. “It was the fi  rst time I saw a way out of the fatalism of 
the campgrounds,” she refl  ected. “The rich get richer, the poor get poorer, everybody 
pushes you down, you don’t have a chance. But in Sunday School they said you did
have a chance, because you’re a child of God.”
Libraries opened a whole new world for her, and the public school promised 
her the same education that every other child received. After Davis’s family settled 
down during World War II, she graduated from high school as the valedictorian of her 
class and began working at an aircraft factory in San Diego. Having edited her high

[4] down during World War II, she graduated from high school as the valedictorian of her 
class and began working at an aircraft factory in San Diego. Having edited her high 
school paper, she dreamed of becoming a journalist and wrote to the national Sun-
day School Department in Springfi  eld. Learning of her interest in writing and editing, 
Marcus Grable invited her to assist with the new Sunday School Counselor magazine.
Only nineteen and having a single change of clothes, she arrived in Springfi eld in 
the early 1940s to collect sixteen dollars a week at headquarters. Giving up plans to 
study at the University of Missouri School of Journalism, she began taking classes at

Drury College (now University). It was during this time that she met George Davis, a 
student at Central Bible College. Married in 1945, she was ordained three years later. 
They went to Costa Rica as missionaries in 1957 and eventually were assigned to pro-
mote Sunday Schools throughout Latin America. With George’s skill as a pilot, they 
fl  ew extensively about the region to workshops and conferences.
Years later, Davis graduated with highest honors from Drury and capped her 
training with a doctorate in education at the University of Miami in Florida. Hoping to 
enter a sociology program, she discovered that the university did not offer a doctor-
ate in that area. Finally, she decided to visit the Education Department to see if they

Cooley’s inauguration as president of Gordon-Conwell Theo-
logical Seminary in 1981 marked a milestone in North American 
Pentecostalism. “‘Historic’ . . . seemed a tame term,” mused Rus-
sell P . Spittler, a leading theologian in the Council. “A minister of 
the Assemblies of God becomes the head of a leading evangelical 
seminary reaching the conclusion of its fi  rst century of service.” 
The welding of establishment Pentecostalism to evangelicalism, 
which had begun in 1942 with membership in the National Asso-

Protestantism.” Founder of the National Alliance of Evangelical Ministries (AMEN, 
Alianza de Ministerios Evangélicos Nacionales), advisor to three American presi-

Miranda grew up in an unpromising environment: a poor barrio in Albuquerque, 
New Mexico, one of fi ve children born to a sawmill worker who had emigrated from 
Chihuahua State in Mexico and a mother of Spanish descent. He came to Christ at 
an early age after members of a nearby Pentecostal church, who had heard that his 
mother was sick, came to the house and prayed for her. Her healing had a dramatic 
effect on the family and young Jesse. 
The church had been in contact with the family for two years before the healing. 
“This little Pentecostal church would come in an old broken-down-bus, pick us up, 
and take me to church—that made the difference,” Miranda recalled. It was at church 
that he learned to write. At Christmastime, when his parents gave clothes as presents

While growing up, the disciplined lifestyle of his father and the spiritual encour-
agement of his mother strongly infl  uenced him. On one occasion, during a church 
service, his mother put her arm around him and told him that she wanted him to 
become an educated man. She then pointed to a man kneeling at the altar in prayer 
as an example: Joe E. Martinez, an Assemblies of God layman and professor at the 
University of New Mexico. “That’s the image that stuck.”

[15] His parents—a Catholic father and mainline Protestant mother—also mentored 
him in the importance of reconciliation. “I remember I was 13 or 14, and I said, ‘Dad, 
Catholics never read the Bible,’ because I never saw him read it. ‘Mother, you read the 
Bible but never come to the book of Acts.’ And then they would turn around and say, 
‘And you Pentecostals never leave the Book of Acts.’ So I saw my shortcomings and 
I saw differences. Yet we loved and respected one another so that we really enjoyed 
our fellowship. And we all affi  rmed one another.” 
At age sixteen, he began to attend Bible school, and his pastor assigned him 
preaching responsibilities a year later. Like other young people who demonstrated 
leadership abilities in Pentecostal churches, his pastor gave him opportunities to

n late summer 1930, William I. Evans, the “principal” of Central Bible Institute 
(CBI) announced that the school year would begin on September 26, and there 
was still room for more students. “We are looking for Jesus to come and, in conse-
quence of that glorious event, we may never conduct the [term],” he remarked. “We 
thank God for the blessed hope. . . . However, we are occupying till He comes. That 
occupation with us is making this Institute count for the very most in the advance-
ment of the Kingdom.” The school preferred mature and “diligent students of the 
Word,” nineteen years of age and older. Accepting applicants below this age might 
mean that at graduation three years later, they could still be “too young to be trusted 
with the responsibilities involved.”

[20] Evans lamented that fi  nding students with the “highest type of consecration 
among us is getting rarer.” Life at a Bible institute contrasted sharply with campus 
life at colleges and universities. Preeminently an experience in spiritual formation, it 
demanded a high level of dedication to stay the course.
The “standards of holiness” required separation from worldly values. “It grieves 
our hearts and we could weep,” he added in disappointment, “when we see world 
conformity among Bible school graduates!” Women especially seem to have been 
the culprits: “We have seen pastors’ wives and lady pastors and leaders dressed so 
much like the world as to show no line of separation.” Hence, “short skirts, low necks, 
sheer clothes, adornments, and worldly style of hair dress, are inexcusable. Certainly 
religion does not consist in what we wear, but genuine religion of the kind we profess

[21] religion does not consist in what we wear, but genuine religion of the kind we profess 
will show itself in these matters.” Hopefully, “only . . . serious-minded youths will 
care to apply themselves to [the school’s] rigor.” 
Although strict discipline characterized all the schools, the atmosphere could 
hardly be described as dull or without humor. Instead, both students and faculty 
members shared a common commitment for the evangelization of the world. Refl ect-
ing the desire of church leaders and grassroots believers alike, Evans pleaded, “We 
want all its facilities from walls and roof to the services of consecrated instructors to 
produce the very utmost in lives for the Kingdom.”

tle recognition for their sacrifi cial efforts. In a report published in the Pentecostal Evan-
gel about the 1937 commencement at Latin American Bible Institute in San Antonio 
and the thirty-fi  ve men and women who graduated, the writer attributed the success 
of the school to the sacrifi  ces of the staff: “Much credit is due to Brother Ball and the 
group of workers who have been assisting him as teachers in the school, since funds 
have never been very plentiful so as to enable anyone to be really remunerated for 
his services; but each has given his time and effort willingly as unto the Lord, trusting 
God for the supply of his individual needs.”

God for the supply of his individual needs.”
Most churches did not fi  nancially support these schools for several reasons: 
First, they sometimes preferred spending their monies on local church ministries 
and/or foreign missions. Second, a long-standing fear of educational preparation 
made many wary of Bible institutes. Third, since the schools operated on faith, God 
would somehow provide for them; indeed, strong fi  nancial backing might jeopardize 
their spiritual vigor. Despite the handicaps that worked against their effectiveness, 
teachers contributed heavily to the spiritual formation of thousands of pastors, evan-
gelists, missionaries, and other church workers.

Bryant’s infl  uence. Enrolling at a Baptist seminary in the Chicago area a year later, he 
found that without an undergraduate degree he was not prepared, so he switched to 
Denison University in Ohio. To cover his expenses, he worked as a manual laborer. 
While there he met his wife, Myrtle Garmong, who then helped him complete the 
program (in seven years).
Still feeling unprepared, he enrolled at Rochester Seminary in 1899. Augustus 
H. Strong, the president and professor of theology, taught the courses in systematic 
theology, and Nelson became one of his students. Strong’s Systematic Theology, fi  rst 
published in 1886, had gone through seven editions and reached nearly twelve hun-
dred pages by the time he got there. “I have discarded none of the Baptist  doctrines,” 
he reminisced many years later, “but have built a story or two on the good solid foun-

[28] he reminisced many years later, “but have built a story or two on the good solid foun-
dation laid for our faith.”
Following graduation, he evangelized and pastored several churches before 
being called to pastor Conley Memorial Baptist Church in Detroit. His contact with 
Pentecostals began in 1920, but they failed to impress him. Nevertheless, a healing 
from a serious and possibly life-threatening infection led him to begin preaching on 
divine healing. But the congregation refused to accept this new teaching, and before 
long he resigned. Shortly after, he was baptized in the Spirit and joined the Assem-
blies of God. 
By now over fi  fty years old and a seasoned minister, he detected that many young 
people in the Assemblies of God were entering the ministry just like he had: with little 
preparation. In 1927 he moved to Enid, Oklahoma, where he founded a church and

MYER PEARLMAN
(1898–1943)
The personalities in this chapter came from widely different backgrounds, and 
Myer Pearlman was no exception. The eldest son of a 
Jewish family, he studied at a synagogue school in Bir-
mingham, England. In school he remembered learning 
the Jewish version of the three R’s: the Jewish faith, the 
Torah (Old Testament), and the Hebrew language. “I was 
taught,” he recalled, “that while I  was to be a patriotic 
Englishman, I was also a Jew, a member of the nation, and 
that I was different from other people. I remember passing 
meat markets, and inwardly thanking God that I did not 
eat unclean meat.”
The economic situation in England forced his  father 
to move the family to the United States in hopes of gain-

[32] meat markets, and inwardly thanking God that I did not 
eat unclean meat.”
The economic situation in England forced his  father 
to move the family to the United States in hopes of gain-
ing employment and improving their living standard. After settling in New York City in 
1915, the younger Pearlman eventually enlisted in the U.S. Army and served eighteen 
months in the medical corps in France. His profi ciency in French helped him in this 
capacity. After the war, he traveled to California where “groping for light I began to 
read religious books and attend services.” 
Sometime later, walking by a mission in San Francisco, he noticed a crowd gath-
ered at the entrance and stopped to listen to the music. On another evening, he 
stood outside again. Mustering his courage, he entered and took a seat. He was par-
ticularly impressed by the music, especially the song “Honey in the Rock,” written by 
F.A. Graves. Based on Deuteronomy 32:13 (“he nourished [Israel] with honey from

[33] ticularly impressed by the music, especially the song “Honey in the Rock,” written by 
F.A. Graves. Based on Deuteronomy 32:13 (“he nourished [Israel] with honey from 
the rock”), it tells of God’s grace and provision from an unexpected source. Verse two 
asks, “Have you ‘tasted that the Lord is gracious?’ Do you walk in the way that’s new? 
Have you drunk from the living fountain? There’s Honey in the Rock [Jesus Christ] 
for you.” Attending nightly, he eventually confessed his sins and became a Christian, 
praying “in the name of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.”
In 1922, Pearlman enrolled at Central Bible Institute, where he later met 
his wife, Irene Graves, daughter of the songwriter. A brilliant student and self-
taught in many areas, he read the Scriptures in Hebrew, Greek, Spanish, French, 
and Italian. At graduation time, the principal, Frank M. Boyd, invited him to join 
the faculty. Pearlman accepted and taught there from 1924 until his death in 1943.

[35] dice and to reconcile social antagonism. The church may offer the world a privatized, 
personal, and ‘spiritual’ brand of Christianity, or it can provide leadership toward a 
more just and humane society exemplifying the kingdom of God.”
Christianity Today noted, “Since the days of playing in backyard junk cars [in the 
barrio], he has not stopped envisioning a better future. Now, he says, his dream is 
that his children and grandchildren will live and work among a broader Christian 
community as a result of his bridge-building.”
The varied endeavors of the persons introduced in this chapter represent the 
notable work of Christian mentors. Paul, too, recognized the value of mentoring when 
he advised his understudy Timothy to “be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus; 
and what you have heard from me through many witnesses entrust to faithful people 
who will be able to teach others as well” (2 Timothy 2:1–2, NRSV).

Over the course of years, he authored three books, wrote hundreds of articles for 
the Evangel and other headquarters’ publications, and became a popular speaker at 
writers’ conferences around the world. Like the Old Testament prophet Habakkuk, he 
told his staff, as well as aspiring writers, that the nature of their work required them 
to “write the vision, and make it plain” (Habakkuk 2:2).
Those who knew Champion remember his ability to affi  rm those with whom he 
worked. When staffers submitted poor articles, he would meet with them person-
ally and review the problems. They would not only leave knowing how to make the 
needed changes, but also feeling positive about themselves and their skills. Friends 
also remember his keen wit.

9. SANCTIFICATION
Sanctifi cation is an act of separation from that which is evil, and of dedication 
unto God (Romans 12:1,2; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; Hebrews 13:12). Scriptures teach a 
life of “holiness without which no man shall see the Lord” (Hebrews 12:14). By the 
power of the Holy Spirit we are able to obey the command: “Be ye holy, for I am holy” 
(1 Peter 1:15,16).
Sanctifi cation is realized in the believer by recognizing his identifi  cation with 
Christ in His death and resurrection, and by faith reckoning daily upon the fact of that 
union, and by offering every faculty continually to the dominion of the Holy Spirit 
(Romans 6:1–11,13; 8:1,2,13; Galatians 2:20; Philippians 2:12,13; 1 Peter 1:5).
10. THE CHURCH AND ITS MISSION
The Church is the body of Christ, the habitation of God through the Spirit, with 
divine appointments for the fulfi  llment of her Great Commission. Each believer, born

T
he Bible is our all–suffi  cient rule for faith and practice. This Statement of Fun-
damental Truths is intended simply as a basis of fellowship among us (i.e., that 
we all speak the same thing, 1 Corinthians 1:10; Acts 2:42). The phraseology 
employed in this statement is not inspired or contended for, but the truth set forth 
is held to be essential to a full–gospel ministry. No claim is made that it contains all 
biblical truth, only that it covers our need as to these fundamental doctrines.
1. THE SCRIPTURES INSPIRED
The Scriptures, both the Old and New Testaments, are verbally inspired of God 
and are the revelation of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and 
conduct (2 Timothy 3:15–17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Peter 1:21).
2. THE ONE TRUE GOD
The one true God has revealed himself as the eternally self–existent “I AM,” the 
Creator of heaven and earth and the Redeemer of mankind. He has further revealed

[3] a. His virgin birth (Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:31,35). 
b. His sinless life (Hebrews 7:26; 1 Peter 2:22).
c. His miracles (Acts 2:22; 10:38).
d. His substitutionary work on the cross (1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
e. His bodily resurrection from the dead (Matthew 28:6; Luke 24:39; 1 Corinthians 
15:4).
f. His exaltation to the right hand of God (Acts 1:9,11; 2:33; Philippians 2:9–11; 
Hebrews 1:3).
4. THE FALL OF MAN
Man was created good and upright; for God said, “Let us make man in our 
image, after our likeness.” However, man by voluntary transgression fell and thereby 
incurred not only physical death but also spiritual death, which is separation from 
God (Genesis 1:26,27; 2:17; 3:6; Romans 5:12–19).
5. THE SALVATION OF MAN
Man’s only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son 
of God.

of a generation of Assemblies of God “post-Pentecostal Pen-

mote Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues.
General Superintendent Wood disputes this pessimistic 
picture in a 2014 centennial interview in Charisma magazine. 
His observations, interviews with leaders, and wide travel

tongues is alive and growing. He affi  rmed that the statistics 
are imperfect, not refl  ecting practices in thousands of churches in recent years.

[6] notes a signifi cant rise in Pentecostal practices, even among those not tradition-
ally labeled Pentecostal or charismatic. For much the evangelical world in particular, 
praying for healing and miracles, exercising spiritual gifts, trusting the Lord for deliv-
erance, and speaking in tongues are all valid biblical practices. This is a signifi  cant 
change within one generation. 
Cessationism (the belief that the manifestations of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians 
12–14 ceased with the death of the original apostles or the close of the New Testa-
ment canon in the fourth century) is a declining movement as believers of all denom-
inations and theological persuasions affi  rm the contemporary work of the Spirit. 
Though many of these groups do not share the “classical” Pentecostal distinctive 
of tongues as the initial physical evident of Spirit baptism, the affi  rmation that the

Spirit works in and through all the gifts is a heartening change. 
There are some signs across the United States that cause concern among 
thoughtful persons. The number of people that answered “none” when asked for reli-
gious affi  liation has grown from a miniscule percentage in the 1980s to 16.1  per-
cent in a 2007 poll by Pew Research. And 28 percent have left the faith they were 
raised in or affi  liate with no religion at all.
1 This refl  ects two trends: (1) the loss of 
denominational loyalty among some that might still (vaguely) identify themselves as 
Christians; and (2) an increasing number of the U.S. population (both immigrant and 
native-born) with no religious affi liation.

[8] “Post-Christian” and “postmodern” are labels tossed about with great frequency 
in popular analysis. The United States remains much more religious than most of 
Western Europe; however, “being spiritual and not religious” is gaining as a category 
of a generation without signifi  cant exposure to the gospel. 
The new challenge for Assemblies of God leaders is evangelization of people with 
no Christian memory. This is a new phenomenon for many U.S. leaders (though not 
for the appointed missionaries of AGWM). 
Another concern among thoughtful adherents is moral compromise with the 
subversion of traditional marriage and sexuality in the last half-century. The public

consensus in the West and the United States of lifelong heterosexual marriage and 
celibacy for singles is no longer the prevailing opinion of popular culture or even 
a majority of people. While strong elements within American society advocate or 
support gay marriage, the Assemblies of God stands fi  rmly committed to scriptural 
teaching that marriage is between a man and a woman.
When confronted by actual or potential compromise in other evangelical or Pen-
tecostal fellowships and organizations, steadfast adherence to biblical marriage is 
quickly affi  rmed. The Assemblies of God leadership has been uncompromising it its 
standards of sexual conduct while affi  rming love for all people broken by sin.

[10] OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD!
The evangelical revivals of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries fueled the 
birth of global missions. The Pentecostal awakenings have accelerated the spread 
of the gospel in the twentieth century. We are now witnesses the re-evangelizing of 
Europe and the United States by missional believers from developing nations. The 
gospel is now going from everywhere to everywhere as former missions fi elds become 
missions-sending agencies. 
When Melvin Hodges penned The Indigenous Church in 1953, the aim of missions was 
a self-sustaining local church and, in the long-term, a self-sustaining national fellow-
ship. These remain important goals; however, a more complete goal is emerging in the 
twenty-fi rst century: establishing churches and fellowships of churches that become 
not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata,

[11] not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around 
the world answer the Great Commission call and become “360  Churches.” Mission-
ary-scholars such as Alan Johnson in Thailand are now articulating an integration of 
apostolic pioneering and church planting united with holistic care for communities. 
In the post-Christian West, Pentecostal spirituality and theology are the answer 
for generations that are hungry for experience and meaning rooted in love and truth. 
Apologetics and careful explanations of truth must be united with the proclamation 
of the Cross and power of the Spirit to deliver, heal, forgive, redeem, and transform.

[12] Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The 
signs and wonders demonstrated in Scripture are alive and well on the frontiers of 
evangelization and missions today. The Assemblies of God has a bright future as we 
recognize those frontiers across the street and around the world.
Gary McGee’s fi nal work, Miracles, Missions and American Pentecostalism (2010), details 
the supernatural confi rmation of the missionary pioneers. As a new Spirit-empowered 
generation hears the call to evangelism, worship, discipleship, and compassion, they 
can expect the Lord of the harvest to again confi  rm the message of grace.

relationship, as to its mode is inscrutable and incomprehensible, because unexplained 
(Luke 1:35; 1 Corinthians 1:24; Matthew 11:25–27; 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14; 1 John 1:3,4).
(c) Unity of the One Being of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
Accordingly, therefore, there is that in the Father which constitutes Him the Father 
and not the Son; there is that in the Son which constitutes Him the Son and not the 
Father; and there is that in the Holy Spirit which constitutes Him the Holy Spirit and 
not either the Father or the Son. Wherefore, the Father is the Begetter; the Son is the 
Begotten; and the Holy Spirit is the One proceeding from the Father and the Son. There-
fore, because these three persons in the godhead are in a state of unity, there is but 
one Lord God Almighty and His name one (John 1:18; 15:26; 17:11,21; Zechariah 14:9).
(d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor

[14] (d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor 
confused as to relation; nor divided in respect to the godhead; nor opposed as to 
cooperation. The Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son as to relationship. 
The Son is with the Father and the Father is with the Son, as to fellowship. The Father 
is not from the Son, but the Son is from the Father, as to authority. The Holy Spirit 
is from the Father and the Son proceeding, as to nature, relationship, cooperation, 
and authority. Hence, no person in the godhead either exists or works separately or 
independently of the others (John 5:17–30,32,37; 8:17,18).
(e) The Title, Lord Jesus Christ
The appellation Lord Jesus Christ, is a proper name. It is never applied in the New 
Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us

[15] Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us
The Lord Jesus Christ, as to His divine and eternal nature, is the proper and only 
Begotten of the Father, but as to His human nature, He is the proper Son of Man. He 
is, therefore, acknowledged to be both God and man; who because He is God and 
man, is “Immanuel,” God with us (Matthew 1:23; 1 John 4:2,10,14; Revelation 1:13,17).
(g) The Title, Son of God
Since the name Immanuel embraces both God and man, in the one person, our 
Lord Jesus Christ, it follows that the title Son of God describes His proper deity, and 
the title Son of Man, His proper humanity. Therefore, the title Son of God belongs to 
the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23; 
2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).

2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).
(h) Transgression of the Doctrine of Christ
Wherefore, it is a transgression of the doctrine of Christ to say that Jesus Christ 
derived the title Son of God solely from the fact of the Incarnation, or because of His 
relation to the economy of redemption. Therefore, to deny that the Father is a real 
and eternal Father, and that the Son is a real and eternal Son, is a denial of the

a. Conditions to Salvation
Salvation is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord 
Jesus Christ. By the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, being 
justifi ed by grace through faith, man becomes an heir of God according to the hope of 
eternal life (Luke 24:47; John 3:3; Romans 10:13–15; Ephesians 2:8; Titus 2:11; 3:5–7).
b. The Evidences of Salvation
The inward evidence of salvation is the direct witness of the Spirit (Romans 8:16). 
The outward evidence to all men is a life of righteousness and true holiness (Ephe-
sians 4:24; Titus 2:12).

The Lord’s Supper, consisting of the elements—bread and the fruit of the vine—is 
the symbol expressing our sharing the divine nature of our Lord Jesus Christ (2 Peter 
1:4); a memorial of His suffering and death (1 Corinthians 11:26); and a prophecy of His 
second coming (1 Corinthians 11:26); and is enjoined on all believers “till He come!”
7. THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
All believers are entitled to and should ardently expect and earnestly seek the 
promise of the Father, the baptism in the Holy Spirit and fi  re, according to the com-
mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the

[19] mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the 
bestowment of the gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry (Luke 24:49; Acts 
1:4,8; 1 Corinthians 12:1–31). This experience is distinct from and subsequent to the 
experience of the new birth (Acts 8:12–17; 10:44–46; 11:14–16; 15:7–9). With the bap-
tism in the Holy Spirit come such experiences as an overfl  owing fullness of the Spirit 
(John 7:37–39; Acts 4:8), a deepened reverence for God (Acts 2:43; Hebrews 12:28), an 
intensifi ed consecration to God and dedication to His work (Acts 2:42), and a more 
active love for Christ, for His Word, and for the lost (Mark 16:20).
8. THE INITIAL PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT

sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts

[20] The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical 
sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts 
2:4). The speaking in tongues in this instance is the same in essence as the gift of 
tongues (1 Corinthians 12:4–10,28), but different in purpose and use.

11. THE MINISTRY
A divinely called and scripturally ordained ministry has been provided by our Lord 
for the fourfold purpose of leading the Church in: (1) evangelization of the world (Mark 
16:15–20), (2) worship of God (John 4:23,24), (3) building a Body of saints being per-
fected in the image of His Son (Ephesians 4:11,16), and (4) meeting human need with 
ministries of love and compassion (Psalm 112:9; Galatians 2:10; 6:10; James 1:27).
12. DIVINE HEALING
Divine healing is an integral part of the gospel. Deliverance from sickness is pro-
vided for in the Atonement, and is the privilege of all believers (Isaiah 53:4,5; Mat-
thew 8:16,17; James 5:14–16).
13. THE BLESSED HOPE
The resurrection of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and their translation 
together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).

[22] together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).
14. THE MILLENNIAL REIGN OF CHRIST
The second coming of Christ includes the rapture of the saints, which is our 
blessed hope, followed by the visible return of Christ with His saints to reign on 
the earth for one thousand years (Zechariah 14:5; Matthew 24:27,30; Revelation 1:7; 
19:11–14; 20:1–6). This millennial reign will bring the salvation of national Israel (Eze-
kiel 37:21,22; Zephaniah 3:19,20; Romans 11:26,27) and the establishment of univer-
sal peace (Isaiah 11:6–9; Psalm 72:3–8; Micah 4:3,4).
15. THE FINAL JUDGMENT
There will be a fi  nal judgment in which the wicked dead will be raised and judged 
according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to

[23] according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to 
everlasting punishment in the lake which burneth with fi  re and brimstone, which is 
the second death (Matthew 25:46; Mark 9:43–48; Revelation 19:20; 20:11–15; 21:8).
16. THE NEW HEAVENS AND THE NEW EARTH
“We, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein 
dwelleth righteousness” (2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 21,22).
Scripture quotations are from the King James Version of the Holy Bible.

Romans 13:7 argues to offer the state worship.  While Christians generally obey and 
submit to earthly authorities, earthly authorities are not absolutes. All submission occurs 
under the umbrella of Christian allegiance to God. His Person and kingdom cannot be 
compared with or subjected to any earthly power. 
 
Witness as Our Core Mission 
For the New Testament writers, being witnesses of God’s reconciling work in Christ is a 
core responsibility of believers . Anything that interferes with this work opposes the 
Christian faith, no matter the motivation. Acting in the name of Christ while  undermining 
the gospel’s presentation and the Church’s mission risks disobedience to Christ (Matthew 
28:19–20). Let it not be said of us that people blaspheme the name of God because of 
us (Romans 2:24). 
 
Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present

Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present  
simplistic answers that create us -vs-them scenarios . Desiring to make a positive 
difference in the world, well-meaning Christians often choose a side and universally adopt 
its stance on all the issues. In so doing, they can alienate others and damage their ability 
to witness to them. In a worst-case scenario, a chosen side might reveal itself as opposing 
Christian faith and virtue.  Christians must be careful in participating in any potentially 
harmful system that does not accurately represent Christ or His kingdom. 
 
Christians should ensure that their civic engagements are in harmony with their core 
task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere .

[28] task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere . 
Believers should take moral stands on issues that matter to God. However, they should 
exercise caution and discernment in how they do so, living as wise agents of Christ ’s 
kingdom. 
 
Salt and Light 
One of Jesus’ best-known teachings contains dual metaphors for Christian engagement 
with the world. “You are the salt of the earth,” He said, and “You are the light of the world” 
(Matthew 5:13–14). In the right measure, salt improves what it touches. Similarly, 
Christians improve their environment. Consider this  test for valid Christian engagement: 
Does our influence make our environment better or worse? 
 
Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in

[29] Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in 
heaven” (Matthew 5:16). Jesus expects His followers to radiate goodness that dispels the 
darkness of evil . The light of their  good works point s to the Father —the Source of 
goodness. It elicits genuine praise for God from those who observe these acts of light . 
Consider another key test  for Christian engagement: Are people drawn to God by our 
public actions and disposition, or are they turned off?

[30] 6 
Love of God and Others 
Jesus was asked, “Of all the commandments, which is the most important?” (Mark 12:28). 
He offered a simple and comprehensive answer: Love God with all your being and love 
others as if they were you. Love is not an add-on; the characteristic of love defines those 
living an authentically Christian faith (John 13:35). 
 
First Corinthians 13 provides the best description of love in the Christian community. This 
list of love ’s characteristics mirrors actions in  every sphere of life, including public li fe. 
Biblical love raises another question: How does our participation in politics and other civic 
duties reflect the criteria of love, regardless of our intentions?  
 
The Role of the Holy Spirit  
All Christians should seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance when engaging in civic and political 
matters. Every aspect of Christian life depends on the Holy Spirit. As in the life of Jesus,

[31] All Christians should seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance when engaging in civic and political 
matters. Every aspect of Christian life depends on the Holy Spirit. As in the life of Jesus, 
the Holy Spirit must play a central role in guiding, facilitating, and empowering believers’ 
private and public lives. Christians engaged in the work of citizenship on their own risk 
the peril faced by the Galatians. They attempted to complete God’s work in the energy of 
the flesh (Galatians 3:3). We must also resist the urge to misuse a spiritual gift to earn  
political approval . To do so would make one no better than the court prophets  of 
Jeremiah’s day , who only prophesied in favor of the king. Are we living  as citizens  
according to the Spirit’s fruit and gifts (Galatians 5:22–23; 1 Corinthians 12, etc.)?

Conclusion 
 
Scripture does not single out one detailed model for Christian participation in civic and 
political spheres. As “the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and conduct,”
5 the Bible does 
offer powerful truths that should guide Christians ’ civic and political lives. T hroughout 
history, Christians have responded as best they could, in different political circumstances, 
as they sought to be faithful  to the Bible  in their unique contexts. From this important 
discussion comes the following summation for careful consideration. 
 
Believers must be mindful of their core identity as people of another kingdom. Allegiance 
to Christ as the only Lord and the defining role as His witnesses is crucial. As Christians 
act in love and as salt and light, under the guiding power of the Holy Spirit, they lead 
others to God, proclaim the gospel, and improve the world around them.

Modern political movements are not centered around God’s destiny for humanity but 
rather focus on their ends. Further, they achieve those ends through power plays that 
rely on the successful domination of others rather than cooperation with the Holy Spirit. 
 
In practical terms, as followers of Christ and ministers of the gospel, we should:

9. SANCTIFICATION
Sanctifi cation is an act of separation from that which is evil, and of dedication 
unto God (Romans 12:1,2; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; Hebrews 13:12). Scriptures teach a 
life of “holiness without which no man shall see the Lord” (Hebrews 12:14). By the 
power of the Holy Spirit we are able to obey the command: “Be ye holy, for I am holy” 
(1 Peter 1:15,16).
Sanctifi cation is realized in the believer by recognizing his identifi  cation with 
Christ in His death and resurrection, and by faith reckoning daily upon the fact of that 
union, and by offering every faculty continually to the dominion of the Holy Spirit 
(Romans 6:1–11,13; 8:1,2,13; Galatians 2:20; Philippians 2:12,13; 1 Peter 1:5).

divine appointments for the fulfi  llment of her Great Commission. Each believer, born

he Bible is our all–suffi  cient rule for faith and practice. This Statement of Fun-
damental Truths is intended simply as a basis of fellowship among us (i.e., that 
we all speak the same thing, 1 Corinthians 1:10; Acts 2:42). The phraseology 
employed in this statement is not inspired or contended for, but the truth set forth 
is held to be essential to a full–gospel ministry. No claim is made that it contains all 
biblical truth, only that it covers our need as to these fundamental doctrines.
1. THE SCRIPTURES INSPIRED
The Scriptures, both the Old and New Testaments, are verbally inspired of God 
and are the revelation of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and 
conduct (2 Timothy 3:15–17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Peter 1:21).
2. THE ONE TRUE GOD
The one true God has revealed himself as the eternally self–existent “I AM,” the 
Creator of heaven and earth and the Redeemer of mankind. He has further revealed

[3] a. His virgin birth (Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:31,35). 
b. His sinless life (Hebrews 7:26; 1 Peter 2:22).
c. His miracles (Acts 2:22; 10:38).
d. His substitutionary work on the cross (1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
e. His bodily resurrection from the dead (Matthew 28:6; Luke 24:39; 1 Corinthians 
15:4).
f. His exaltation to the right hand of God (Acts 1:9,11; 2:33; Philippians 2:9–11; 
Hebrews 1:3).
4. THE FALL OF MAN
Man was created good and upright; for God said, “Let us make man in our 
image, after our likeness.” However, man by voluntary transgression fell and thereby 
incurred not only physical death but also spiritual death, which is separation from 
God (Genesis 1:26,27; 2:17; 3:6; Romans 5:12–19).
5. THE SALVATION OF MAN
Man’s only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son 
of God.

[13] gifts, and healing without the universality of Spirit baptism 
and tongues. There is a real danger, in the words of Earl Creps, 
of a generation of Assemblies of God “post-Pentecostal Pen-
tecostals” that affi  rm the Statement of Fundamental Truths 
and enjoy relationships, but do not seek to practice or pro-
mote Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues.
General Superintendent Wood disputes this pessimistic 
picture in a 2014 centennial interview in Charisma magazine. 
His observations, interviews with leaders, and wide travel 
affi rm that Spirit baptism with the initial physical evidence of 
tongues is alive and growing. He affi  rmed that the statistics 
are imperfect, not refl  ecting practices in thousands of churches in recent years.

notes a signifi cant rise in Pentecostal practices, even among those not tradition-
ally labeled Pentecostal or charismatic. For much the evangelical world in particular,

[14] notes a signifi cant rise in Pentecostal practices, even among those not tradition-
ally labeled Pentecostal or charismatic. For much the evangelical world in particular, 
praying for healing and miracles, exercising spiritual gifts, trusting the Lord for deliv-
erance, and speaking in tongues are all valid biblical practices. This is a signifi  cant 
change within one generation. 
Cessationism (the belief that the manifestations of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians 
12–14 ceased with the death of the original apostles or the close of the New Testa-
ment canon in the fourth century) is a declining movement as believers of all denom-
inations and theological persuasions affi  rm the contemporary work of the Spirit. 
Though many of these groups do not share the “classical” Pentecostal distinctive 
of tongues as the initial physical evident of Spirit baptism, the affi  rmation that the 
Spirit works in and through all the gifts is a heartening change.

[15] of tongues as the initial physical evident of Spirit baptism, the affi  rmation that the

There are some signs across the United States that cause concern among 
thoughtful persons. The number of people that answered “none” when asked for reli-
gious affi  liation has grown from a miniscule percentage in the 1980s to 16.1  per-
cent in a 2007 poll by Pew Research. And 28 percent have left the faith they were 
raised in or affi  liate with no religion at all.
1 This refl  ects two trends: (1) the loss of 
denominational loyalty among some that might still (vaguely) identify themselves as 
Christians; and (2) an increasing number of the U.S. population (both immigrant and 
native-born) with no religious affi liation.

[16] “Post-Christian” and “postmodern” are labels tossed about with great frequency 
in popular analysis. The United States remains much more religious than most of 
Western Europe; however, “being spiritual and not religious” is gaining as a category 
of a generation without signifi  cant exposure to the gospel. 
The new challenge for Assemblies of God leaders is evangelization of people with 
no Christian memory. This is a new phenomenon for many U.S. leaders (though not 
for the appointed missionaries of AGWM). 
Another concern among thoughtful adherents is moral compromise with the 
subversion of traditional marriage and sexuality in the last half-century. The public

consensus in the West and the United States of lifelong heterosexual marriage and 
celibacy for singles is no longer the prevailing opinion of popular culture or even 
a majority of people. While strong elements within American society advocate or 
support gay marriage, the Assemblies of God stands fi  rmly committed to scriptural 
teaching that marriage is between a man and a woman.
When confronted by actual or potential compromise in other evangelical or Pen-
tecostal fellowships and organizations, steadfast adherence to biblical marriage is 
quickly affi  rmed. The Assemblies of God leadership has been uncompromising it its 
standards of sexual conduct while affi  rming love for all people broken by sin.

[18] OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD!
The evangelical revivals of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries fueled the 
birth of global missions. The Pentecostal awakenings have accelerated the spread 
of the gospel in the twentieth century. We are now witnesses the re-evangelizing of 
Europe and the United States by missional believers from developing nations. The 
gospel is now going from everywhere to everywhere as former missions fi elds become 
missions-sending agencies. 
When Melvin Hodges penned The Indigenous Church in 1953, the aim of missions was 
a self-sustaining local church and, in the long-term, a self-sustaining national fellow-
ship. These remain important goals; however, a more complete goal is emerging in the 
twenty-fi rst century: establishing churches and fellowships of churches that become 
not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around

[19] not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around 
the world answer the Great Commission call and become “360  Churches.” Mission-
ary-scholars such as Alan Johnson in Thailand are now articulating an integration of 
apostolic pioneering and church planting united with holistic care for communities. 
In the post-Christian West, Pentecostal spirituality and theology are the answer 
for generations that are hungry for experience and meaning rooted in love and truth. 
Apologetics and careful explanations of truth must be united with the proclamation 
of the Cross and power of the Spirit to deliver, heal, forgive, redeem, and transform. 
Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The 
signs and wonders demonstrated in Scripture are alive and well on the frontiers of

[20] Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The 
signs and wonders demonstrated in Scripture are alive and well on the frontiers of 
evangelization and missions today. The Assemblies of God has a bright future as we 
recognize those frontiers across the street and around the world.
Gary McGee’s fi nal work, Miracles, Missions and American Pentecostalism (2010), details 
the supernatural confi rmation of the missionary pioneers. As a new Spirit-empowered 
generation hears the call to evangelism, worship, discipleship, and compassion, they 
can expect the Lord of the harvest to again confi  rm the message of grace.

relationship, as to its mode is inscrutable and incomprehensible, because unexplained 
(Luke 1:35; 1 Corinthians 1:24; Matthew 11:25–27; 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14; 1 John 1:3,4).
(c) Unity of the One Being of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
Accordingly, therefore, there is that in the Father which constitutes Him the Father 
and not the Son; there is that in the Son which constitutes Him the Son and not the 
Father; and there is that in the Holy Spirit which constitutes Him the Holy Spirit and 
not either the Father or the Son. Wherefore, the Father is the Begetter; the Son is the 
Begotten; and the Holy Spirit is the One proceeding from the Father and the Son. There-
fore, because these three persons in the godhead are in a state of unity, there is but 
one Lord God Almighty and His name one (John 1:18; 15:26; 17:11,21; Zechariah 14:9).
(d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor

[22] (d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor 
confused as to relation; nor divided in respect to the godhead; nor opposed as to 
cooperation. The Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son as to relationship. 
The Son is with the Father and the Father is with the Son, as to fellowship. The Father 
is not from the Son, but the Son is from the Father, as to authority. The Holy Spirit 
is from the Father and the Son proceeding, as to nature, relationship, cooperation, 
and authority. Hence, no person in the godhead either exists or works separately or 
independently of the others (John 5:17–30,32,37; 8:17,18).
(e) The Title, Lord Jesus Christ
The appellation Lord Jesus Christ, is a proper name. It is never applied in the New 
Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us

[23] Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us
The Lord Jesus Christ, as to His divine and eternal nature, is the proper and only 
Begotten of the Father, but as to His human nature, He is the proper Son of Man. He 
is, therefore, acknowledged to be both God and man; who because He is God and 
man, is “Immanuel,” God with us (Matthew 1:23; 1 John 4:2,10,14; Revelation 1:13,17).
(g) The Title, Son of God
Since the name Immanuel embraces both God and man, in the one person, our 
Lord Jesus Christ, it follows that the title Son of God describes His proper deity, and 
the title Son of Man, His proper humanity. Therefore, the title Son of God belongs to 
the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23; 
2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).
(h) Transgression of the Doctrine of Christ

[24] the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23; 
2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).
(h) Transgression of the Doctrine of Christ
Wherefore, it is a transgression of the doctrine of Christ to say that Jesus Christ 
derived the title Son of God solely from the fact of the Incarnation, or because of His 
relation to the economy of redemption. Therefore, to deny that the Father is a real 
and eternal Father, and that the Son is a real and eternal Son, is a denial of the

a. Conditions to Salvation
Salvation is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord 
Jesus Christ. By the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, being 
justifi ed by grace through faith, man becomes an heir of God according to the hope of 
eternal life (Luke 24:47; John 3:3; Romans 10:13–15; Ephesians 2:8; Titus 2:11; 3:5–7).
b. The Evidences of Salvation
The inward evidence of salvation is the direct witness of the Spirit (Romans 8:16). 
The outward evidence to all men is a life of righteousness and true holiness (Ephe-
sians 4:24; Titus 2:12).
 6. THE ORDINANCES OF THE CHURCH
a. Baptism in Water
The ordinance of baptism by immersion is commanded in the Scriptures. All who 
repent and believe on Christ as Savior and Lord are to be baptized. Thus they declare 
to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with

[26] repent and believe on Christ as Savior and Lord are to be baptized. Thus they declare 
to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with 
Him to walk in newness of life (Matthew 28:19; Mark 16:16; Acts 10:47,48; Romans 6:4).
b. Holy Communion
The Lord’s Supper, consisting of the elements—bread and the fruit of the vine—is 
the symbol expressing our sharing the divine nature of our Lord Jesus Christ (2 Peter 
1:4); a memorial of His suffering and death (1 Corinthians 11:26); and a prophecy of His 
second coming (1 Corinthians 11:26); and is enjoined on all believers “till He come!”
7. THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
All believers are entitled to and should ardently expect and earnestly seek the 
promise of the Father, the baptism in the Holy Spirit and fi  re, according to the com-
mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the

[27] mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the 
bestowment of the gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry (Luke 24:49; Acts 
1:4,8; 1 Corinthians 12:1–31). This experience is distinct from and subsequent to the 
experience of the new birth (Acts 8:12–17; 10:44–46; 11:14–16; 15:7–9). With the bap-
tism in the Holy Spirit come such experiences as an overfl  owing fullness of the Spirit 
(John 7:37–39; Acts 4:8), a deepened reverence for God (Acts 2:43; Hebrews 12:28), an 
intensifi ed consecration to God and dedication to His work (Acts 2:42), and a more 
active love for Christ, for His Word, and for the lost (Mark 16:20).
8. THE INITIAL PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical 
sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts

[28] The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical 
sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts 
2:4). The speaking in tongues in this instance is the same in essence as the gift of 
tongues (1 Corinthians 12:4–10,28), but different in purpose and use.

11. THE MINISTRY
A divinely called and scripturally ordained ministry has been provided by our Lord 
for the fourfold purpose of leading the Church in: (1) evangelization of the world (Mark 
16:15–20), (2) worship of God (John 4:23,24), (3) building a Body of saints being per-
fected in the image of His Son (Ephesians 4:11,16), and (4) meeting human need with 
ministries of love and compassion (Psalm 112:9; Galatians 2:10; 6:10; James 1:27).
12. DIVINE HEALING
Divine healing is an integral part of the gospel. Deliverance from sickness is pro-
vided for in the Atonement, and is the privilege of all believers (Isaiah 53:4,5; Mat-
thew 8:16,17; James 5:14–16).
13. THE BLESSED HOPE
The resurrection of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and their translation 
together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).

[30] together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).
14. THE MILLENNIAL REIGN OF CHRIST
The second coming of Christ includes the rapture of the saints, which is our 
blessed hope, followed by the visible return of Christ with His saints to reign on 
the earth for one thousand years (Zechariah 14:5; Matthew 24:27,30; Revelation 1:7; 
19:11–14; 20:1–6). This millennial reign will bring the salvation of national Israel (Eze-
kiel 37:21,22; Zephaniah 3:19,20; Romans 11:26,27) and the establishment of univer-
sal peace (Isaiah 11:6–9; Psalm 72:3–8; Micah 4:3,4).
15. THE FINAL JUDGMENT
There will be a fi  nal judgment in which the wicked dead will be raised and judged 
according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to

[31] according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to 
everlasting punishment in the lake which burneth with fi  re and brimstone, which is 
the second death (Matthew 25:46; Mark 9:43–48; Revelation 19:20; 20:11–15; 21:8).
16. THE NEW HEAVENS AND THE NEW EARTH
“We, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein 
dwelleth righteousness” (2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 21,22).
Scripture quotations are from the King James Version of the Holy Bible.

9. SANCTIFICATION
Sanctifi cation is an act of separation from that which is evil, and of dedication 
unto God (Romans 12:1,2; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; Hebrews 13:12). Scriptures teach a 
life of “holiness without which no man shall see the Lord” (Hebrews 12:14). By the 
power of the Holy Spirit we are able to obey the command: “Be ye holy, for I am holy” 
(1 Peter 1:15,16).
Sanctifi cation is realized in the believer by recognizing his identifi  cation with 
Christ in His death and resurrection, and by faith reckoning daily upon the fact of that 
union, and by offering every faculty continually to the dominion of the Holy Spirit 
(Romans 6:1–11,13; 8:1,2,13; Galatians 2:20; Philippians 2:12,13; 1 Peter 1:5).

T
he Bible is our all–suffi  cient rule for faith and practice. This Statement of Fun-
damental Truths is intended simply as a basis of fellowship among us (i.e., that 
we all speak the same thing, 1 Corinthians 1:10; Acts 2:42). The phraseology 
employed in this statement is not inspired or contended for, but the truth set forth 
is held to be essential to a full–gospel ministry. No claim is made that it contains all 
biblical truth, only that it covers our need as to these fundamental doctrines.
1. THE SCRIPTURES INSPIRED
The Scriptures, both the Old and New Testaments, are verbally inspired of God 
and are the revelation of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and 
conduct (2 Timothy 3:15–17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Peter 1:21).
2. THE ONE TRUE GOD
The one true God has revealed himself as the eternally self–existent “I AM,” the 
Creator of heaven and earth and the Redeemer of mankind. He has further revealed

[3] a. His virgin birth (Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:31,35). 
b. His sinless life (Hebrews 7:26; 1 Peter 2:22).
c. His miracles (Acts 2:22; 10:38).
d. His substitutionary work on the cross (1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
e. His bodily resurrection from the dead (Matthew 28:6; Luke 24:39; 1 Corinthians 
15:4).
f. His exaltation to the right hand of God (Acts 1:9,11; 2:33; Philippians 2:9–11; 
Hebrews 1:3).
4. THE FALL OF MAN
Man was created good and upright; for God said, “Let us make man in our 
image, after our likeness.” However, man by voluntary transgression fell and thereby 
incurred not only physical death but also spiritual death, which is separation from 
God (Genesis 1:26,27; 2:17; 3:6; Romans 5:12–19).
5. THE SALVATION OF MAN
Man’s only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son 
of God.

10. avoid any nationalism or identity politics that elevates political identities and 
obscures a primary allegiance to Christ. Such conduct is divisive, potentially 
idolatrous, and leads away from the Assemblies of God’ s mission to evangelize 
the lost, worship God, disciple believers, and show compassion,  as expressed in 
Articles 10 and 11 of the Statement of Fundamental Truths. 
 
6 “10 Guidelines for Christian Voters,” Pentecostal Evangel, October 14, 1984, 13. Full text: “1. Do not confuse patriotism, national 
pride, and Western culture with Christian faith and practice. 2. Do not confuse secular political activity with the purpose of the church 
nor campaigning with witnessing and preaching. 3. Do not make slanderous or false accusations against your opponents but 
maintain your integrity. Do not consider a brother or sister who is of like precious faith an adversary if he or she holds a different

Romans 13:7 argues to offer the state worship.  While Christians generally obey and 
submit to earthly authorities, earthly authorities are not absolutes. All submission occurs 
under the umbrella of Christian allegiance to God. His Person and kingdom cannot be 
compared with or subjected to any earthly power. 
 
Witness as Our Core Mission 
For the New Testament writers, being witnesses of God’s reconciling work in Christ is a 
core responsibility of believers . Anything that interferes with this work opposes the 
Christian faith, no matter the motivation. Acting in the name of Christ while  undermining 
the gospel’s presentation and the Church’s mission risks disobedience to Christ (Matthew 
28:19–20). Let it not be said of us that people blaspheme the name of God because of 
us (Romans 2:24). 
 
Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present

Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present  
simplistic answers that create us -vs-them scenarios . Desiring to make a positive 
difference in the world, well-meaning Christians often choose a side and universally adopt 
its stance on all the issues. In so doing, they can alienate others and damage their ability 
to witness to them. In a worst-case scenario, a chosen side might reveal itself as opposing 
Christian faith and virtue.  Christians must be careful in participating in any potentially 
harmful system that does not accurately represent Christ or His kingdom. 
 
Christians should ensure that their civic engagements are in harmony with their core 
task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere .

[7] task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere . 
Believers should take moral stands on issues that matter to God. However, they should 
exercise caution and discernment in how they do so, living as wise agents of Christ ’s 
kingdom. 
 
Salt and Light 
One of Jesus’ best-known teachings contains dual metaphors for Christian engagement 
with the world. “You are the salt of the earth,” He said, and “You are the light of the world” 
(Matthew 5:13–14). In the right measure, salt improves what it touches. Similarly, 
Christians improve their environment. Consider this  test for valid Christian engagement: 
Does our influence make our environment better or worse? 
 
Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in

[8] Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in 
heaven” (Matthew 5:16). Jesus expects His followers to radiate goodness that dispels the 
darkness of evil . The light of their  good works point s to the Father —the Source of 
goodness. It elicits genuine praise for God from those who observe these acts of light . 
Consider another key test  for Christian engagement: Are people drawn to God by our 
public actions and disposition, or are they turned off?

[9] 6 
Love of God and Others 
Jesus was asked, “Of all the commandments, which is the most important?” (Mark 12:28). 
He offered a simple and comprehensive answer: Love God with all your being and love 
others as if they were you. Love is not an add-on; the characteristic of love defines those 
living an authentically Christian faith (John 13:35). 
 
First Corinthians 13 provides the best description of love in the Christian community. This 
list of love ’s characteristics mirrors actions in  every sphere of life, including public li fe. 
Biblical love raises another question: How does our participation in politics and other civic 
duties reflect the criteria of love, regardless of our intentions?  
 
The Role of the Holy Spirit  
All Christians should seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance when engaging in civic and political 
matters. Every aspect of Christian life depends on the Holy Spirit. As in the life of Jesus,

[10] All Christians should seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance when engaging in civic and political 
matters. Every aspect of Christian life depends on the Holy Spirit. As in the life of Jesus, 
the Holy Spirit must play a central role in guiding, facilitating, and empowering believers’ 
private and public lives. Christians engaged in the work of citizenship on their own risk 
the peril faced by the Galatians. They attempted to complete God’s work in the energy of 
the flesh (Galatians 3:3). We must also resist the urge to misuse a spiritual gift to earn  
political approval . To do so would make one no better than the court prophets  of 
Jeremiah’s day , who only prophesied in favor of the king. Are we living  as citizens  
according to the Spirit’s fruit and gifts (Galatians 5:22–23; 1 Corinthians 12, etc.)? 
 
Conclusion 
 
Scripture does not single out one detailed model for Christian participation in civic and

[11] according to the Spirit’s fruit and gifts (Galatians 5:22–23; 1 Corinthians 12, etc.)? 
 
Conclusion 
 
Scripture does not single out one detailed model for Christian participation in civic and 
political spheres. As “the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and conduct,”
5 the Bible does 
offer powerful truths that should guide Christians ’ civic and political lives. T hroughout 
history, Christians have responded as best they could, in different political circumstances, 
as they sought to be faithful  to the Bible  in their unique contexts. From this important 
discussion comes the following summation for careful consideration. 
 
Believers must be mindful of their core identity as people of another kingdom. Allegiance 
to Christ as the only Lord and the defining role as His witnesses is crucial. As Christians 
act in love and as salt and light, under the guiding power of the Holy Spirit, they lead 
others to God, proclaim the gospel, and improve the world around them.

[12] act in love and as salt and light, under the guiding power of the Holy Spirit, they lead 
others to God, proclaim the gospel, and improve the world around them. 
 
Modern political movements are not centered around God’s destiny for humanity but 
rather focus on their ends. Further, they achieve those ends through power plays that 
rely on the successful domination of others rather than cooperation with the Holy Spirit. 
 
In practical terms, as followers of Christ and ministers of the gospel, we should:  
 
1. prioritize the gospel and its propagation far above personal and political 
allegiances;

of a generation of Assemblies of God “post-Pentecostal Pen-

and enjoy relationships, but do not seek to practice or pro-
mote Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues.

His observations, interviews with leaders, and wide travel

[14] notes a signifi cant rise in Pentecostal practices, even among those not tradition-
ally labeled Pentecostal or charismatic. For much the evangelical world in particular, 
praying for healing and miracles, exercising spiritual gifts, trusting the Lord for deliv-
erance, and speaking in tongues are all valid biblical practices. This is a signifi  cant 
change within one generation. 
Cessationism (the belief that the manifestations of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians 
12–14 ceased with the death of the original apostles or the close of the New Testa-
ment canon in the fourth century) is a declining movement as believers of all denom-
inations and theological persuasions affi  rm the contemporary work of the Spirit. 
Though many of these groups do not share the “classical” Pentecostal distinctive

gious affi  liation has grown from a miniscule percentage in the 1980s to 16.1  per-
cent in a 2007 poll by Pew Research. And 28 percent have left the faith they were 
raised in or affi  liate with no religion at all.
1 This refl  ects two trends: (1) the loss of 
denominational loyalty among some that might still (vaguely) identify themselves as 
Christians; and (2) an increasing number of the U.S. population (both immigrant and 
native-born) with no religious affi liation.  
“Post-Christian” and “postmodern” are labels tossed about with great frequency

[16] “Post-Christian” and “postmodern” are labels tossed about with great frequency 
in popular analysis. The United States remains much more religious than most of 
Western Europe; however, “being spiritual and not religious” is gaining as a category 
of a generation without signifi  cant exposure to the gospel. 
The new challenge for Assemblies of God leaders is evangelization of people with 
no Christian memory. This is a new phenomenon for many U.S. leaders (though not 
for the appointed missionaries of AGWM). 
Another concern among thoughtful adherents is moral compromise with the 
subversion of traditional marriage and sexuality in the last half-century. The public

consensus in the West and the United States of lifelong heterosexual marriage and 
celibacy for singles is no longer the prevailing opinion of popular culture or even 
a majority of people. While strong elements within American society advocate or 
support gay marriage, the Assemblies of God stands fi  rmly committed to scriptural 
teaching that marriage is between a man and a woman.
When confronted by actual or potential compromise in other evangelical or Pen-
tecostal fellowships and organizations, steadfast adherence to biblical marriage is 
quickly affi  rmed. The Assemblies of God leadership has been uncompromising it its 
standards of sexual conduct while affi  rming love for all people broken by sin.

[18] OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD!
The evangelical revivals of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries fueled the 
birth of global missions. The Pentecostal awakenings have accelerated the spread 
of the gospel in the twentieth century. We are now witnesses the re-evangelizing of 
Europe and the United States by missional believers from developing nations. The 
gospel is now going from everywhere to everywhere as former missions fi elds become 
missions-sending agencies. 
When Melvin Hodges penned The Indigenous Church in 1953, the aim of missions was 
a self-sustaining local church and, in the long-term, a self-sustaining national fellow-
ship. These remain important goals; however, a more complete goal is emerging in the 
twenty-fi rst century: establishing churches and fellowships of churches that become 
not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around

[19] not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around 
the world answer the Great Commission call and become “360  Churches.” Mission-
ary-scholars such as Alan Johnson in Thailand are now articulating an integration of 
apostolic pioneering and church planting united with holistic care for communities. 
In the post-Christian West, Pentecostal spirituality and theology are the answer 
for generations that are hungry for experience and meaning rooted in love and truth. 
Apologetics and careful explanations of truth must be united with the proclamation 
of the Cross and power of the Spirit to deliver, heal, forgive, redeem, and transform. 
Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The 
signs and wonders demonstrated in Scripture are alive and well on the frontiers of

[20] Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The 
signs and wonders demonstrated in Scripture are alive and well on the frontiers of 
evangelization and missions today. The Assemblies of God has a bright future as we 
recognize those frontiers across the street and around the world.
Gary McGee’s fi nal work, Miracles, Missions and American Pentecostalism (2010), details 
the supernatural confi rmation of the missionary pioneers. As a new Spirit-empowered 
generation hears the call to evangelism, worship, discipleship, and compassion, they 
can expect the Lord of the harvest to again confi  rm the message of grace.

relationship, as to its mode is inscrutable and incomprehensible, because unexplained 
(Luke 1:35; 1 Corinthians 1:24; Matthew 11:25–27; 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14; 1 John 1:3,4).
(c) Unity of the One Being of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
Accordingly, therefore, there is that in the Father which constitutes Him the Father 
and not the Son; there is that in the Son which constitutes Him the Son and not the 
Father; and there is that in the Holy Spirit which constitutes Him the Holy Spirit and 
not either the Father or the Son. Wherefore, the Father is the Begetter; the Son is the 
Begotten; and the Holy Spirit is the One proceeding from the Father and the Son. There-
fore, because these three persons in the godhead are in a state of unity, there is but 
one Lord God Almighty and His name one (John 1:18; 15:26; 17:11,21; Zechariah 14:9).
(d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor

[22] (d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor 
confused as to relation; nor divided in respect to the godhead; nor opposed as to 
cooperation. The Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son as to relationship. 
The Son is with the Father and the Father is with the Son, as to fellowship. The Father 
is not from the Son, but the Son is from the Father, as to authority. The Holy Spirit 
is from the Father and the Son proceeding, as to nature, relationship, cooperation, 
and authority. Hence, no person in the godhead either exists or works separately or 
independently of the others (John 5:17–30,32,37; 8:17,18).
(e) The Title, Lord Jesus Christ
The appellation Lord Jesus Christ, is a proper name. It is never applied in the New 
Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us

[23] Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us
The Lord Jesus Christ, as to His divine and eternal nature, is the proper and only 
Begotten of the Father, but as to His human nature, He is the proper Son of Man. He 
is, therefore, acknowledged to be both God and man; who because He is God and 
man, is “Immanuel,” God with us (Matthew 1:23; 1 John 4:2,10,14; Revelation 1:13,17).
(g) The Title, Son of God
Since the name Immanuel embraces both God and man, in the one person, our 
Lord Jesus Christ, it follows that the title Son of God describes His proper deity, and 
the title Son of Man, His proper humanity. Therefore, the title Son of God belongs to 
the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23; 
2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).
(h) Transgression of the Doctrine of Christ

[24] the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23; 
2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).
(h) Transgression of the Doctrine of Christ
Wherefore, it is a transgression of the doctrine of Christ to say that Jesus Christ 
derived the title Son of God solely from the fact of the Incarnation, or because of His 
relation to the economy of redemption. Therefore, to deny that the Father is a real 
and eternal Father, and that the Son is a real and eternal Son, is a denial of the

a. Conditions to Salvation
Salvation is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord 
Jesus Christ. By the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, being 
justifi ed by grace through faith, man becomes an heir of God according to the hope of 
eternal life (Luke 24:47; John 3:3; Romans 10:13–15; Ephesians 2:8; Titus 2:11; 3:5–7).
b. The Evidences of Salvation
The inward evidence of salvation is the direct witness of the Spirit (Romans 8:16). 
The outward evidence to all men is a life of righteousness and true holiness (Ephe-
sians 4:24; Titus 2:12).
 6. THE ORDINANCES OF THE CHURCH
a. Baptism in Water
The ordinance of baptism by immersion is commanded in the Scriptures. All who 
repent and believe on Christ as Savior and Lord are to be baptized. Thus they declare 
to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with

[26] repent and believe on Christ as Savior and Lord are to be baptized. Thus they declare 
to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with 
Him to walk in newness of life (Matthew 28:19; Mark 16:16; Acts 10:47,48; Romans 6:4).
b. Holy Communion
The Lord’s Supper, consisting of the elements—bread and the fruit of the vine—is 
the symbol expressing our sharing the divine nature of our Lord Jesus Christ (2 Peter 
1:4); a memorial of His suffering and death (1 Corinthians 11:26); and a prophecy of His 
second coming (1 Corinthians 11:26); and is enjoined on all believers “till He come!”
7. THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
All believers are entitled to and should ardently expect and earnestly seek the 
promise of the Father, the baptism in the Holy Spirit and fi  re, according to the com-
mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the

[27] mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the 
bestowment of the gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry (Luke 24:49; Acts 
1:4,8; 1 Corinthians 12:1–31). This experience is distinct from and subsequent to the 
experience of the new birth (Acts 8:12–17; 10:44–46; 11:14–16; 15:7–9). With the bap-
tism in the Holy Spirit come such experiences as an overfl  owing fullness of the Spirit 
(John 7:37–39; Acts 4:8), a deepened reverence for God (Acts 2:43; Hebrews 12:28), an 
intensifi ed consecration to God and dedication to His work (Acts 2:42), and a more 
active love for Christ, for His Word, and for the lost (Mark 16:20).
8. THE INITIAL PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical 
sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts

[28] The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical 
sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts 
2:4). The speaking in tongues in this instance is the same in essence as the gift of 
tongues (1 Corinthians 12:4–10,28), but different in purpose and use.

11. THE MINISTRY
A divinely called and scripturally ordained ministry has been provided by our Lord 
for the fourfold purpose of leading the Church in: (1) evangelization of the world (Mark 
16:15–20), (2) worship of God (John 4:23,24), (3) building a Body of saints being per-
fected in the image of His Son (Ephesians 4:11,16), and (4) meeting human need with 
ministries of love and compassion (Psalm 112:9; Galatians 2:10; 6:10; James 1:27).
12. DIVINE HEALING
Divine healing is an integral part of the gospel. Deliverance from sickness is pro-
vided for in the Atonement, and is the privilege of all believers (Isaiah 53:4,5; Mat-
thew 8:16,17; James 5:14–16).
13. THE BLESSED HOPE
The resurrection of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and their translation 
together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).

[30] together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).
14. THE MILLENNIAL REIGN OF CHRIST
The second coming of Christ includes the rapture of the saints, which is our 
blessed hope, followed by the visible return of Christ with His saints to reign on 
the earth for one thousand years (Zechariah 14:5; Matthew 24:27,30; Revelation 1:7; 
19:11–14; 20:1–6). This millennial reign will bring the salvation of national Israel (Eze-
kiel 37:21,22; Zephaniah 3:19,20; Romans 11:26,27) and the establishment of univer-
sal peace (Isaiah 11:6–9; Psalm 72:3–8; Micah 4:3,4).
15. THE FINAL JUDGMENT
There will be a fi  nal judgment in which the wicked dead will be raised and judged 
according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to

[31] according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to 
everlasting punishment in the lake which burneth with fi  re and brimstone, which is 
the second death (Matthew 25:46; Mark 9:43–48; Revelation 19:20; 20:11–15; 21:8).
16. THE NEW HEAVENS AND THE NEW EARTH
“We, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein 
dwelleth righteousness” (2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 21,22).
Scripture quotations are from the King James Version of the Holy Bible.
