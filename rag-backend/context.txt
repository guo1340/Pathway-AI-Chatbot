he Bible is our all–suffi  cient rule for faith and practice. This Statement of Fun-
damental Truths is intended simply as a basis of fellowship among us (i.e., that 
we all speak the same thing, 1 Corinthians 1:10; Acts 2:42). The phraseology 
employed in this statement is not inspired or contended for, but the truth set forth 
is held to be essential to a full–gospel ministry. No claim is made that it contains all 
biblical truth, only that it covers our need as to these fundamental doctrines.
1. THE SCRIPTURES INSPIRED
The Scriptures, both the Old and New Testaments, are verbally inspired of God 
and are the revelation of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and 
conduct (2 Timothy 3:15–17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Peter 1:21).
2. THE ONE TRUE GOD
The one true God has revealed himself as the eternally self–existent “I AM,” the 
Creator of heaven and earth and the Redeemer of mankind. He has further revealed

9. SANCTIFICATION
Sanctifi cation is an act of separation from that which is evil, and of dedication 
unto God (Romans 12:1,2; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; Hebrews 13:12). Scriptures teach a 
life of “holiness without which no man shall see the Lord” (Hebrews 12:14). By the 
power of the Holy Spirit we are able to obey the command: “Be ye holy, for I am holy” 
(1 Peter 1:15,16).
Sanctifi cation is realized in the believer by recognizing his identifi  cation with 
Christ in His death and resurrection, and by faith reckoning daily upon the fact of that 
union, and by offering every faculty continually to the dominion of the Holy Spirit 
(Romans 6:1–11,13; 8:1,2,13; Galatians 2:20; Philippians 2:12,13; 1 Peter 1:5).
10. THE CHURCH AND ITS MISSION
The Church is the body of Christ, the habitation of God through the Spirit, with 
divine appointments for the fulfi  llment of her Great Commission. Each believer, born

[3] a. His virgin birth (Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:31,35). 
b. His sinless life (Hebrews 7:26; 1 Peter 2:22).
c. His miracles (Acts 2:22; 10:38).
d. His substitutionary work on the cross (1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
e. His bodily resurrection from the dead (Matthew 28:6; Luke 24:39; 1 Corinthians 
15:4).
f. His exaltation to the right hand of God (Acts 1:9,11; 2:33; Philippians 2:9–11; 
Hebrews 1:3).
4. THE FALL OF MAN
Man was created good and upright; for God said, “Let us make man in our 
image, after our likeness.” However, man by voluntary transgression fell and thereby 
incurred not only physical death but also spiritual death, which is separation from 
God (Genesis 1:26,27; 2:17; 3:6; Romans 5:12–19).
5. THE SALVATION OF MAN
Man’s only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son 
of God.

Do not allow the details to detract from the main thing. 
Prophetic predictions, charts, and debates about the details can be interesting. 
However, they are often a distraction from the main message. It is im portant not to let 
debatable details distract from the important c ore belief in Christ’s coming. The 
imminent return of Jesus  motivates, encourages, and unites us in our mission.  
Show charity to other believers in disagreements over eschatology. 
The Assemblies of God has defined the boundaries of its eschatology with the 
formulation of the Statement of Fundamental Truths. However, the Statement of 
Fundamental Truths does not set the boundaries for being a Christian. We 
recognize that Christians  can d isagree on matters that are not essential to salvation, 
even if it involves the interpretation of Scripture. Eschatology matters, but not all 
Christians hold the same beliefs about eschatology. God has called all Christians to 
s

[6] from the spiritual deadness of the historic churches. They wanted nothing to do with 
lifeless creeds and confessions. Thus, the formulation of the Statement of Fundamental 
Truths amounted to the reluctant swallowing of a bitter pill. Nevertheless, concern to 
protect the faithful from doctrinal error won out. 
Two years later in 1918, internal controversy brewed when old questions resur-
faced over the necessity of tongues as evidence of Spirit baptism. Church leaders 
once again had to refl  ect on the organization’s doctrinal and spiritual identity. After 
much discussion, the Council reaffi rmed the doctrine of initial evidence and high-
lighted it as the “distinctive testimony of the Assemblies of God.”

EXPANDING MINISTRIES
Ministers, missionaries, and laypersons concentrated their energies on many 
different activities in serving God. These included street meetings, revivals, camp 
meetings, church plantings, missions, and other activities. John Welch, the secretary

[7] Jesus.7 In 1961, the General Council responded to a growing number of minis ters 
holding to amillennial views by including a pr ohibition of teaching amillennialism. 8 In 
2023, the General Council revised those bylaws  to emphasize the right to 
address other views for educational purposes, but that ministers should r efrain 
from “intentionally leading others astray” regarding the four core eschatologic al 
teachings of the Assemblies of God.  
The Statement of Fundamental Truths clearly affirms premillennial doctr ine, but it 
is important not to dogm atize other elements  of end-t ime beliefs that ar e not 
specifically addressed. These include details about the identity of the Antichrist (2 
Thessalonians 2:3; 2 John 7), the battle of Armageddon (Revelation 16:16), the m ark of 
the Beast (Revelation 13:16–17), and the Great Tribulation (Matthew 24:21; Revelation 
7:14). While ministers may hav e convictions about specific interpretations of

“Two Kingdoms” and Reformed approaches. In twenty-first-century America, some in the 
AG stressed political power as a way to promote biblical values.  
 
Articles 10 and 11 of the “Statement of Fundamental Truths” describe the mission of the 
Church as evangelizing, worshipping God, building up believers, and showing 
compassion. This mission intersects with the political and social world. Yet, believers who 
aim to glorify God and rightly reflect His kingdom must govern such activities by mission 
principles.

Do not allow the details to detract from the main thing. 
Prophetic predictions, charts, and debates about the details can be interesting. 
However, they are often a distraction from the main message. It is im portant not to let 
debatable details distract from the important c ore belief in Christ’s coming. The 
imminent return of Jesus  motivates, encourages, and unites us in our mission.  
Show charity to other believers in disagreements over eschatology. 
The Assemblies of God has defined the boundaries of its eschatology with the 
formulation of the Statement of Fundamental Truths. However, the Statement of 
Fundamental Truths does not set the boundaries for being a Christian. We 
recognize that Christians  can d isagree on matters that are not essential to salvation, 
even if it involves the interpretation of Scripture. Eschatology matters, but not all 
Christians hold the same beliefs about eschatology. God has called all Christians to 
s

[6] from the spiritual deadness of the historic churches. They wanted nothing to do with 
lifeless creeds and confessions. Thus, the formulation of the Statement of Fundamental 
Truths amounted to the reluctant swallowing of a bitter pill. Nevertheless, concern to 
protect the faithful from doctrinal error won out. 
Two years later in 1918, internal controversy brewed when old questions resur-
faced over the necessity of tongues as evidence of Spirit baptism. Church leaders 
once again had to refl  ect on the organization’s doctrinal and spiritual identity. After 
much discussion, the Council reaffi rmed the doctrine of initial evidence and high-
lighted it as the “distinctive testimony of the Assemblies of God.”

EXPANDING MINISTRIES
Ministers, missionaries, and laypersons concentrated their energies on many 
different activities in serving God. These included street meetings, revivals, camp 
meetings, church plantings, missions, and other activities. John Welch, the secretary

holding to amillennial views by including a pr ohibition of teaching amillennialism. 8 In 
2023, the General Council revised those bylaws  to emphasize the right to 
address other views for educational purposes, but that ministers should r efrain 
from “intentionally leading others astray” regarding the four core eschatologic al 
teachings of the Assemblies of God.  
The Statement of Fundamental Truths clearly affirms premillennial doctr ine, but it 
is important not to dogm atize other elements  of end-t ime beliefs that ar e not 
specifically addressed. These include details about the identity of the Antichrist (2 
Thessalonians 2:3; 2 John 7), the battle of Armageddon (Revelation 16:16), the m ark of 
the Beast (Revelation 13:16–17), and the Great Tribulation (Matthew 24:21; Revelation 
7:14). While ministers may hav e convictions about specific interpretations of

“Two Kingdoms” and Reformed approaches. In twenty-first-century America, some in the 
AG stressed political power as a way to promote biblical values.  
 
Articles 10 and 11 of the “Statement of Fundamental Truths” describe the mission of the 
Church as evangelizing, worshipping God, building up believers, and showing 
compassion. This mission intersects with the political and social world. Yet, believers who 
aim to glorify God and rightly reflect His kingdom must govern such activities by mission 
principles.

9. SANCTIFICATION
Sanctifi cation is an act of separation from that which is evil, and of dedication 
unto God (Romans 12:1,2; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; Hebrews 13:12). Scriptures teach a 
life of “holiness without which no man shall see the Lord” (Hebrews 12:14). By the 
power of the Holy Spirit we are able to obey the command: “Be ye holy, for I am holy” 
(1 Peter 1:15,16).
Sanctifi cation is realized in the believer by recognizing his identifi  cation with 
Christ in His death and resurrection, and by faith reckoning daily upon the fact of that 
union, and by offering every faculty continually to the dominion of the Holy Spirit 
(Romans 6:1–11,13; 8:1,2,13; Galatians 2:20; Philippians 2:12,13; 1 Peter 1:5).
10. THE CHURCH AND ITS MISSION
The Church is the body of Christ, the habitation of God through the Spirit, with 
divine appointments for the fulfi  llment of her Great Commission. Each believer, born

T
he Bible is our all–suffi  cient rule for faith and practice. This Statement of Fun-
damental Truths is intended simply as a basis of fellowship among us (i.e., that 
we all speak the same thing, 1 Corinthians 1:10; Acts 2:42). The phraseology 
employed in this statement is not inspired or contended for, but the truth set forth 
is held to be essential to a full–gospel ministry. No claim is made that it contains all 
biblical truth, only that it covers our need as to these fundamental doctrines.
1. THE SCRIPTURES INSPIRED
The Scriptures, both the Old and New Testaments, are verbally inspired of God 
and are the revelation of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and 
conduct (2 Timothy 3:15–17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Peter 1:21).
2. THE ONE TRUE GOD
The one true God has revealed himself as the eternally self–existent “I AM,” the 
Creator of heaven and earth and the Redeemer of mankind. He has further revealed

[3] a. His virgin birth (Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:31,35). 
b. His sinless life (Hebrews 7:26; 1 Peter 2:22).
c. His miracles (Acts 2:22; 10:38).
d. His substitutionary work on the cross (1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
e. His bodily resurrection from the dead (Matthew 28:6; Luke 24:39; 1 Corinthians 
15:4).
f. His exaltation to the right hand of God (Acts 1:9,11; 2:33; Philippians 2:9–11; 
Hebrews 1:3).
4. THE FALL OF MAN
Man was created good and upright; for God said, “Let us make man in our 
image, after our likeness.” However, man by voluntary transgression fell and thereby 
incurred not only physical death but also spiritual death, which is separation from 
God (Genesis 1:26,27; 2:17; 3:6; Romans 5:12–19).
5. THE SALVATION OF MAN
Man’s only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son 
of God.

Romans 13:7 argues to offer the state worship.  While Christians generally obey and 
submit to earthly authorities, earthly authorities are not absolutes. All submission occurs 
under the umbrella of Christian allegiance to God. His Person and kingdom cannot be 
compared with or subjected to any earthly power. 
 
Witness as Our Core Mission 
For the New Testament writers, being witnesses of God’s reconciling work in Christ is a 
core responsibility of believers . Anything that interferes with this work opposes the 
Christian faith, no matter the motivation. Acting in the name of Christ while  undermining 
the gospel’s presentation and the Church’s mission risks disobedience to Christ (Matthew 
28:19–20). Let it not be said of us that people blaspheme the name of God because of 
us (Romans 2:24). 
 
Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present

Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present  
simplistic answers that create us -vs-them scenarios . Desiring to make a positive 
difference in the world, well-meaning Christians often choose a side and universally adopt 
its stance on all the issues. In so doing, they can alienate others and damage their ability 
to witness to them. In a worst-case scenario, a chosen side might reveal itself as opposing 
Christian faith and virtue.  Christians must be careful in participating in any potentially 
harmful system that does not accurately represent Christ or His kingdom. 
 
Christians should ensure that their civic engagements are in harmony with their core 
task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere .

[7] task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere . 
Believers should take moral stands on issues that matter to God. However, they should 
exercise caution and discernment in how they do so, living as wise agents of Christ ’s 
kingdom. 
 
Salt and Light 
One of Jesus’ best-known teachings contains dual metaphors for Christian engagement 
with the world. “You are the salt of the earth,” He said, and “You are the light of the world” 
(Matthew 5:13–14). In the right measure, salt improves what it touches. Similarly, 
Christians improve their environment. Consider this  test for valid Christian engagement: 
Does our influence make our environment better or worse? 
 
Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in

[8] Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in 
heaven” (Matthew 5:16). Jesus expects His followers to radiate goodness that dispels the 
darkness of evil . The light of their  good works point s to the Father —the Source of 
goodness. It elicits genuine praise for God from those who observe these acts of light . 
Consider another key test  for Christian engagement: Are people drawn to God by our 
public actions and disposition, or are they turned off?

[9] 6 
Love of God and Others 
Jesus was asked, “Of all the commandments, which is the most important?” (Mark 12:28). 
He offered a simple and comprehensive answer: Love God with all your being and love 
others as if they were you. Love is not an add-on; the characteristic of love defines those 
living an authentically Christian faith (John 13:35). 
 
First Corinthians 13 provides the best description of love in the Christian community. This 
list of love ’s characteristics mirrors actions in  every sphere of life, including public li fe. 
Biblical love raises another question: How does our participation in politics and other civic 
duties reflect the criteria of love, regardless of our intentions?  
 
The Role of the Holy Spirit  
All Christians should seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance when engaging in civic and political 
matters. Every aspect of Christian life depends on the Holy Spirit. As in the life of Jesus,

[10] All Christians should seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance when engaging in civic and political 
matters. Every aspect of Christian life depends on the Holy Spirit. As in the life of Jesus, 
the Holy Spirit must play a central role in guiding, facilitating, and empowering believers’ 
private and public lives. Christians engaged in the work of citizenship on their own risk 
the peril faced by the Galatians. They attempted to complete God’s work in the energy of 
the flesh (Galatians 3:3). We must also resist the urge to misuse a spiritual gift to earn  
political approval . To do so would make one no better than the court prophets  of 
Jeremiah’s day , who only prophesied in favor of the king. Are we living  as citizens  
according to the Spirit’s fruit and gifts (Galatians 5:22–23; 1 Corinthians 12, etc.)? 
 
Conclusion 
 
Scripture does not single out one detailed model for Christian participation in civic and

[11] according to the Spirit’s fruit and gifts (Galatians 5:22–23; 1 Corinthians 12, etc.)? 
 
Conclusion 
 
Scripture does not single out one detailed model for Christian participation in civic and 
political spheres. As “the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and conduct,”
5 the Bible does 
offer powerful truths that should guide Christians ’ civic and political lives. T hroughout 
history, Christians have responded as best they could, in different political circumstances, 
as they sought to be faithful  to the Bible  in their unique contexts. From this important 
discussion comes the following summation for careful consideration. 
 
Believers must be mindful of their core identity as people of another kingdom. Allegiance 
to Christ as the only Lord and the defining role as His witnesses is crucial. As Christians 
act in love and as salt and light, under the guiding power of the Holy Spirit, they lead 
others to God, proclaim the gospel, and improve the world around them.

[12] act in love and as salt and light, under the guiding power of the Holy Spirit, they lead

Modern political movements are not centered around God’s destiny for humanity but 
rather focus on their ends. Further, they achieve those ends through power plays that 
rely on the successful domination of others rather than cooperation with the Holy Spirit. 
 
In practical terms, as followers of Christ and ministers of the gospel, we should:

allegiances;

[13] gifts, and healing without the universality of Spirit baptism 
and tongues. There is a real danger, in the words of Earl Creps, 
of a generation of Assemblies of God “post-Pentecostal Pen-
tecostals” that affi  rm the Statement of Fundamental Truths 
and enjoy relationships, but do not seek to practice or pro-
mote Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues.
General Superintendent Wood disputes this pessimistic 
picture in a 2014 centennial interview in Charisma magazine. 
His observations, interviews with leaders, and wide travel 
affi rm that Spirit baptism with the initial physical evidence of 
tongues is alive and growing. He affi  rmed that the statistics 
are imperfect, not refl  ecting practices in thousands of churches in recent years.

ally labeled Pentecostal or charismatic. For much the evangelical world in particular,

[14] notes a signifi cant rise in Pentecostal practices, even among those not tradition-
ally labeled Pentecostal or charismatic. For much the evangelical world in particular, 
praying for healing and miracles, exercising spiritual gifts, trusting the Lord for deliv-
erance, and speaking in tongues are all valid biblical practices. This is a signifi  cant 
change within one generation. 
Cessationism (the belief that the manifestations of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians 
12–14 ceased with the death of the original apostles or the close of the New Testa-
ment canon in the fourth century) is a declining movement as believers of all denom-
inations and theological persuasions affi  rm the contemporary work of the Spirit. 
Though many of these groups do not share the “classical” Pentecostal distinctive 
of tongues as the initial physical evident of Spirit baptism, the affi  rmation that the 
Spirit works in and through all the gifts is a heartening change.

[15] of tongues as the initial physical evident of Spirit baptism, the affi  rmation that the 
Spirit works in and through all the gifts is a heartening change. 
There are some signs across the United States that cause concern among 
thoughtful persons. The number of people that answered “none” when asked for reli-
gious affi  liation has grown from a miniscule percentage in the 1980s to 16.1  per-
cent in a 2007 poll by Pew Research. And 28 percent have left the faith they were 
raised in or affi  liate with no religion at all.
1 This refl  ects two trends: (1) the loss of 
denominational loyalty among some that might still (vaguely) identify themselves as 
Christians; and (2) an increasing number of the U.S. population (both immigrant and 
native-born) with no religious affi liation.  
“Post-Christian” and “postmodern” are labels tossed about with great frequency

[16] “Post-Christian” and “postmodern” are labels tossed about with great frequency 
in popular analysis. The United States remains much more religious than most of 
Western Europe; however, “being spiritual and not religious” is gaining as a category 
of a generation without signifi  cant exposure to the gospel. 
The new challenge for Assemblies of God leaders is evangelization of people with 
no Christian memory. This is a new phenomenon for many U.S. leaders (though not 
for the appointed missionaries of AGWM). 
Another concern among thoughtful adherents is moral compromise with the 
subversion of traditional marriage and sexuality in the last half-century. The public

consensus in the West and the United States of lifelong heterosexual marriage and 
celibacy for singles is no longer the prevailing opinion of popular culture or even 
a majority of people. While strong elements within American society advocate or 
support gay marriage, the Assemblies of God stands fi  rmly committed to scriptural 
teaching that marriage is between a man and a woman.
When confronted by actual or potential compromise in other evangelical or Pen-
tecostal fellowships and organizations, steadfast adherence to biblical marriage is 
quickly affi  rmed. The Assemblies of God leadership has been uncompromising it its 
standards of sexual conduct while affi  rming love for all people broken by sin.

[18] OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD!
The evangelical revivals of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries fueled the 
birth of global missions. The Pentecostal awakenings have accelerated the spread 
of the gospel in the twentieth century. We are now witnesses the re-evangelizing of 
Europe and the United States by missional believers from developing nations. The 
gospel is now going from everywhere to everywhere as former missions fi elds become 
missions-sending agencies. 
When Melvin Hodges penned The Indigenous Church in 1953, the aim of missions was 
a self-sustaining local church and, in the long-term, a self-sustaining national fellow-
ship. These remain important goals; however, a more complete goal is emerging in the 
twenty-fi rst century: establishing churches and fellowships of churches that become 
not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around

[19] not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around 
the world answer the Great Commission call and become “360  Churches.” Mission-
ary-scholars such as Alan Johnson in Thailand are now articulating an integration of 
apostolic pioneering and church planting united with holistic care for communities. 
In the post-Christian West, Pentecostal spirituality and theology are the answer 
for generations that are hungry for experience and meaning rooted in love and truth. 
Apologetics and careful explanations of truth must be united with the proclamation 
of the Cross and power of the Spirit to deliver, heal, forgive, redeem, and transform. 
Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The

[20] Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The 
signs and wonders demonstrated in Scripture are alive and well on the frontiers of 
evangelization and missions today. The Assemblies of God has a bright future as we 
recognize those frontiers across the street and around the world.
Gary McGee’s fi nal work, Miracles, Missions and American Pentecostalism (2010), details 
the supernatural confi rmation of the missionary pioneers. As a new Spirit-empowered 
generation hears the call to evangelism, worship, discipleship, and compassion, they 
can expect the Lord of the harvest to again confi  rm the message of grace.

(Luke 1:35; 1 Corinthians 1:24; Matthew 11:25–27; 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14; 1 John 1:3,4).
(c) Unity of the One Being of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
Accordingly, therefore, there is that in the Father which constitutes Him the Father 
and not the Son; there is that in the Son which constitutes Him the Son and not the 
Father; and there is that in the Holy Spirit which constitutes Him the Holy Spirit and 
not either the Father or the Son. Wherefore, the Father is the Begetter; the Son is the 
Begotten; and the Holy Spirit is the One proceeding from the Father and the Son. There-
fore, because these three persons in the godhead are in a state of unity, there is but 
one Lord God Almighty and His name one (John 1:18; 15:26; 17:11,21; Zechariah 14:9).
(d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor

[22] (d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor 
confused as to relation; nor divided in respect to the godhead; nor opposed as to 
cooperation. The Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son as to relationship. 
The Son is with the Father and the Father is with the Son, as to fellowship. The Father 
is not from the Son, but the Son is from the Father, as to authority. The Holy Spirit 
is from the Father and the Son proceeding, as to nature, relationship, cooperation, 
and authority. Hence, no person in the godhead either exists or works separately or 
independently of the others (John 5:17–30,32,37; 8:17,18).
(e) The Title, Lord Jesus Christ
The appellation Lord Jesus Christ, is a proper name. It is never applied in the New 
Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us

[23] Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us
The Lord Jesus Christ, as to His divine and eternal nature, is the proper and only 
Begotten of the Father, but as to His human nature, He is the proper Son of Man. He 
is, therefore, acknowledged to be both God and man; who because He is God and 
man, is “Immanuel,” God with us (Matthew 1:23; 1 John 4:2,10,14; Revelation 1:13,17).
(g) The Title, Son of God
Since the name Immanuel embraces both God and man, in the one person, our 
Lord Jesus Christ, it follows that the title Son of God describes His proper deity, and 
the title Son of Man, His proper humanity. Therefore, the title Son of God belongs to 
the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23;

(h) Transgression of the Doctrine of Christ
Wherefore, it is a transgression of the doctrine of Christ to say that Jesus Christ 
derived the title Son of God solely from the fact of the Incarnation, or because of His 
relation to the economy of redemption. Therefore, to deny that the Father is a real

a. Conditions to Salvation
Salvation is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord 
Jesus Christ. By the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, being 
justifi ed by grace through faith, man becomes an heir of God according to the hope of 
eternal life (Luke 24:47; John 3:3; Romans 10:13–15; Ephesians 2:8; Titus 2:11; 3:5–7).
b. The Evidences of Salvation
The inward evidence of salvation is the direct witness of the Spirit (Romans 8:16). 
The outward evidence to all men is a life of righteousness and true holiness (Ephe-
sians 4:24; Titus 2:12).
 6. THE ORDINANCES OF THE CHURCH
a. Baptism in Water
The ordinance of baptism by immersion is commanded in the Scriptures. All who 
repent and believe on Christ as Savior and Lord are to be baptized. Thus they declare 
to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with

[26] repent and believe on Christ as Savior and Lord are to be baptized. Thus they declare 
to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with 
Him to walk in newness of life (Matthew 28:19; Mark 16:16; Acts 10:47,48; Romans 6:4).
b. Holy Communion
The Lord’s Supper, consisting of the elements—bread and the fruit of the vine—is 
the symbol expressing our sharing the divine nature of our Lord Jesus Christ (2 Peter 
1:4); a memorial of His suffering and death (1 Corinthians 11:26); and a prophecy of His 
second coming (1 Corinthians 11:26); and is enjoined on all believers “till He come!”
7. THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
All believers are entitled to and should ardently expect and earnestly seek the 
promise of the Father, the baptism in the Holy Spirit and fi  re, according to the com-
mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the

[27] mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the 
bestowment of the gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry (Luke 24:49; Acts 
1:4,8; 1 Corinthians 12:1–31). This experience is distinct from and subsequent to the 
experience of the new birth (Acts 8:12–17; 10:44–46; 11:14–16; 15:7–9). With the bap-
tism in the Holy Spirit come such experiences as an overfl  owing fullness of the Spirit 
(John 7:37–39; Acts 4:8), a deepened reverence for God (Acts 2:43; Hebrews 12:28), an 
intensifi ed consecration to God and dedication to His work (Acts 2:42), and a more 
active love for Christ, for His Word, and for the lost (Mark 16:20).

[28] The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical 
sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts

tongues (1 Corinthians 12:4–10,28), but different in purpose and use.

11. THE MINISTRY
A divinely called and scripturally ordained ministry has been provided by our Lord 
for the fourfold purpose of leading the Church in: (1) evangelization of the world (Mark 
16:15–20), (2) worship of God (John 4:23,24), (3) building a Body of saints being per-
fected in the image of His Son (Ephesians 4:11,16), and (4) meeting human need with 
ministries of love and compassion (Psalm 112:9; Galatians 2:10; 6:10; James 1:27).
12. DIVINE HEALING
Divine healing is an integral part of the gospel. Deliverance from sickness is pro-
vided for in the Atonement, and is the privilege of all believers (Isaiah 53:4,5; Mat-
thew 8:16,17; James 5:14–16).
13. THE BLESSED HOPE
The resurrection of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and their translation 
together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).

[30] together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).
14. THE MILLENNIAL REIGN OF CHRIST
The second coming of Christ includes the rapture of the saints, which is our 
blessed hope, followed by the visible return of Christ with His saints to reign on 
the earth for one thousand years (Zechariah 14:5; Matthew 24:27,30; Revelation 1:7; 
19:11–14; 20:1–6). This millennial reign will bring the salvation of national Israel (Eze-
kiel 37:21,22; Zephaniah 3:19,20; Romans 11:26,27) and the establishment of univer-
sal peace (Isaiah 11:6–9; Psalm 72:3–8; Micah 4:3,4).
15. THE FINAL JUDGMENT
There will be a fi  nal judgment in which the wicked dead will be raised and judged 
according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to

[31] according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to 
everlasting punishment in the lake which burneth with fi  re and brimstone, which is 
the second death (Matthew 25:46; Mark 9:43–48; Revelation 19:20; 20:11–15; 21:8).
16. THE NEW HEAVENS AND THE NEW EARTH
“We, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein 
dwelleth righteousness” (2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 21,22).
Scripture quotations are from the King James Version of the Holy Bible.

9. SANCTIFICATION
Sanctifi cation is an act of separation from that which is evil, and of dedication 
unto God (Romans 12:1,2; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; Hebrews 13:12). Scriptures teach a 
life of “holiness without which no man shall see the Lord” (Hebrews 12:14). By the 
power of the Holy Spirit we are able to obey the command: “Be ye holy, for I am holy” 
(1 Peter 1:15,16).
Sanctifi cation is realized in the believer by recognizing his identifi  cation with 
Christ in His death and resurrection, and by faith reckoning daily upon the fact of that 
union, and by offering every faculty continually to the dominion of the Holy Spirit 
(Romans 6:1–11,13; 8:1,2,13; Galatians 2:20; Philippians 2:12,13; 1 Peter 1:5).

divine appointments for the fulfi  llment of her Great Commission. Each believer, born

T
he Bible is our all–suffi  cient rule for faith and practice. This Statement of Fun-
damental Truths is intended simply as a basis of fellowship among us (i.e., that 
we all speak the same thing, 1 Corinthians 1:10; Acts 2:42). The phraseology 
employed in this statement is not inspired or contended for, but the truth set forth 
is held to be essential to a full–gospel ministry. No claim is made that it contains all 
biblical truth, only that it covers our need as to these fundamental doctrines.
1. THE SCRIPTURES INSPIRED
The Scriptures, both the Old and New Testaments, are verbally inspired of God 
and are the revelation of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and 
conduct (2 Timothy 3:15–17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Peter 1:21).
2. THE ONE TRUE GOD
The one true God has revealed himself as the eternally self–existent “I AM,” the 
Creator of heaven and earth and the Redeemer of mankind. He has further revealed

[3] a. His virgin birth (Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:31,35). 
b. His sinless life (Hebrews 7:26; 1 Peter 2:22).
c. His miracles (Acts 2:22; 10:38).
d. His substitutionary work on the cross (1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
e. His bodily resurrection from the dead (Matthew 28:6; Luke 24:39; 1 Corinthians 
15:4).
f. His exaltation to the right hand of God (Acts 1:9,11; 2:33; Philippians 2:9–11; 
Hebrews 1:3).
4. THE FALL OF MAN
Man was created good and upright; for God said, “Let us make man in our 
image, after our likeness.” However, man by voluntary transgression fell and thereby 
incurred not only physical death but also spiritual death, which is separation from 
God (Genesis 1:26,27; 2:17; 3:6; Romans 5:12–19).
5. THE SALVATION OF MAN
Man’s only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son 
of God.

10. avoid any nationalism or identity politics that elevates political identities and 
obscures a primary allegiance to Christ. Such conduct is divisive, potentially 
idolatrous, and leads away from the Assemblies of God’ s mission to evangelize 
the lost, worship God, disciple believers, and show compassion,  as expressed in 
Articles 10 and 11 of the Statement of Fundamental Truths. 
 
6 “10 Guidelines for Christian Voters,” Pentecostal Evangel, October 14, 1984, 13. Full text: “1. Do not confuse patriotism, national 
pride, and Western culture with Christian faith and practice. 2. Do not confuse secular political activity with the purpose of the church 
nor campaigning with witnessing and preaching. 3. Do not make slanderous or false accusations against your opponents but 
maintain your integrity. Do not consider a brother or sister who is of like precious faith an adversary if he or she holds a different

Romans 13:7 argues to offer the state worship.  While Christians generally obey and 
submit to earthly authorities, earthly authorities are not absolutes. All submission occurs 
under the umbrella of Christian allegiance to God. His Person and kingdom cannot be 
compared with or subjected to any earthly power. 
 
Witness as Our Core Mission 
For the New Testament writers, being witnesses of God’s reconciling work in Christ is a 
core responsibility of believers . Anything that interferes with this work opposes the 
Christian faith, no matter the motivation. Acting in the name of Christ while  undermining 
the gospel’s presentation and the Church’s mission risks disobedience to Christ (Matthew 
28:19–20). Let it not be said of us that people blaspheme the name of God because of 
us (Romans 2:24). 
 
Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present

Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present  
simplistic answers that create us -vs-them scenarios . Desiring to make a positive 
difference in the world, well-meaning Christians often choose a side and universally adopt 
its stance on all the issues. In so doing, they can alienate others and damage their ability 
to witness to them. In a worst-case scenario, a chosen side might reveal itself as opposing 
Christian faith and virtue.  Christians must be careful in participating in any potentially 
harmful system that does not accurately represent Christ or His kingdom. 
 
Christians should ensure that their civic engagements are in harmony with their core 
task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere .

[7] task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere . 
Believers should take moral stands on issues that matter to God. However, they should 
exercise caution and discernment in how they do so, living as wise agents of Christ ’s 
kingdom. 
 
Salt and Light 
One of Jesus’ best-known teachings contains dual metaphors for Christian engagement 
with the world. “You are the salt of the earth,” He said, and “You are the light of the world” 
(Matthew 5:13–14). In the right measure, salt improves what it touches. Similarly, 
Christians improve their environment. Consider this  test for valid Christian engagement: 
Does our influence make our environment better or worse? 
 
Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in

[8] Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in 
heaven” (Matthew 5:16). Jesus expects His followers to radiate goodness that dispels the 
darkness of evil . The light of their  good works point s to the Father —the Source of 
goodness. It elicits genuine praise for God from those who observe these acts of light . 
Consider another key test  for Christian engagement: Are people drawn to God by our 
public actions and disposition, or are they turned off?

[9] 6 
Love of God and Others 
Jesus was asked, “Of all the commandments, which is the most important?” (Mark 12:28). 
He offered a simple and comprehensive answer: Love God with all your being and love 
others as if they were you. Love is not an add-on; the characteristic of love defines those 
living an authentically Christian faith (John 13:35). 
 
First Corinthians 13 provides the best description of love in the Christian community. This 
list of love ’s characteristics mirrors actions in  every sphere of life, including public li fe. 
Biblical love raises another question: How does our participation in politics and other civic 
duties reflect the criteria of love, regardless of our intentions?  
 
The Role of the Holy Spirit  
All Christians should seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance when engaging in civic and political 
matters. Every aspect of Christian life depends on the Holy Spirit. As in the life of Jesus,

[10] All Christians should seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance when engaging in civic and political 
matters. Every aspect of Christian life depends on the Holy Spirit. As in the life of Jesus, 
the Holy Spirit must play a central role in guiding, facilitating, and empowering believers’ 
private and public lives. Christians engaged in the work of citizenship on their own risk 
the peril faced by the Galatians. They attempted to complete God’s work in the energy of 
the flesh (Galatians 3:3). We must also resist the urge to misuse a spiritual gift to earn  
political approval . To do so would make one no better than the court prophets  of 
Jeremiah’s day , who only prophesied in favor of the king. Are we living  as citizens  
according to the Spirit’s fruit and gifts (Galatians 5:22–23; 1 Corinthians 12, etc.)? 
 
Conclusion 
 
Scripture does not single out one detailed model for Christian participation in civic and

[11] according to the Spirit’s fruit and gifts (Galatians 5:22–23; 1 Corinthians 12, etc.)? 
 
Conclusion 
 
Scripture does not single out one detailed model for Christian participation in civic and 
political spheres. As “the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and conduct,”
5 the Bible does 
offer powerful truths that should guide Christians ’ civic and political lives. T hroughout 
history, Christians have responded as best they could, in different political circumstances, 
as they sought to be faithful  to the Bible  in their unique contexts. From this important 
discussion comes the following summation for careful consideration. 
 
Believers must be mindful of their core identity as people of another kingdom. Allegiance 
to Christ as the only Lord and the defining role as His witnesses is crucial. As Christians 
act in love and as salt and light, under the guiding power of the Holy Spirit, they lead 
others to God, proclaim the gospel, and improve the world around them.

[12] act in love and as salt and light, under the guiding power of the Holy Spirit, they lead 
others to God, proclaim the gospel, and improve the world around them. 
 
Modern political movements are not centered around God’s destiny for humanity but 
rather focus on their ends. Further, they achieve those ends through power plays that 
rely on the successful domination of others rather than cooperation with the Holy Spirit. 
 
In practical terms, as followers of Christ and ministers of the gospel, we should:  
 
1. prioritize the gospel and its propagation far above personal and political 
allegiances;

[13] gifts, and healing without the universality of Spirit baptism 
and tongues. There is a real danger, in the words of Earl Creps, 
of a generation of Assemblies of God “post-Pentecostal Pen-
tecostals” that affi  rm the Statement of Fundamental Truths 
and enjoy relationships, but do not seek to practice or pro-
mote Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues.
General Superintendent Wood disputes this pessimistic 
picture in a 2014 centennial interview in Charisma magazine. 
His observations, interviews with leaders, and wide travel 
affi rm that Spirit baptism with the initial physical evidence of 
tongues is alive and growing. He affi  rmed that the statistics 
are imperfect, not refl  ecting practices in thousands of churches in recent years.
A recent Pew Research study evaluating both American and global Christianity 
notes a signifi cant rise in Pentecostal practices, even among those not tradition-
ally labeled Pentecostal or charismatic. For much the evangelical world in particular,

[14] notes a signifi cant rise in Pentecostal practices, even among those not tradition-
ally labeled Pentecostal or charismatic. For much the evangelical world in particular, 
praying for healing and miracles, exercising spiritual gifts, trusting the Lord for deliv-
erance, and speaking in tongues are all valid biblical practices. This is a signifi  cant 
change within one generation. 
Cessationism (the belief that the manifestations of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians 
12–14 ceased with the death of the original apostles or the close of the New Testa-
ment canon in the fourth century) is a declining movement as believers of all denom-
inations and theological persuasions affi  rm the contemporary work of the Spirit. 
Though many of these groups do not share the “classical” Pentecostal distinctive 
of tongues as the initial physical evident of Spirit baptism, the affi  rmation that the 
Spirit works in and through all the gifts is a heartening change.

[15] of tongues as the initial physical evident of Spirit baptism, the affi  rmation that the 
Spirit works in and through all the gifts is a heartening change. 
There are some signs across the United States that cause concern among 
thoughtful persons. The number of people that answered “none” when asked for reli-
gious affi  liation has grown from a miniscule percentage in the 1980s to 16.1  per-
cent in a 2007 poll by Pew Research. And 28 percent have left the faith they were 
raised in or affi  liate with no religion at all.
1 This refl  ects two trends: (1) the loss of 
denominational loyalty among some that might still (vaguely) identify themselves as 
Christians; and (2) an increasing number of the U.S. population (both immigrant and 
native-born) with no religious affi liation.  
“Post-Christian” and “postmodern” are labels tossed about with great frequency

[16] “Post-Christian” and “postmodern” are labels tossed about with great frequency 
in popular analysis. The United States remains much more religious than most of 
Western Europe; however, “being spiritual and not religious” is gaining as a category 
of a generation without signifi  cant exposure to the gospel. 
The new challenge for Assemblies of God leaders is evangelization of people with 
no Christian memory. This is a new phenomenon for many U.S. leaders (though not 
for the appointed missionaries of AGWM). 
Another concern among thoughtful adherents is moral compromise with the 
subversion of traditional marriage and sexuality in the last half-century. The public

consensus in the West and the United States of lifelong heterosexual marriage and 
celibacy for singles is no longer the prevailing opinion of popular culture or even 
a majority of people. While strong elements within American society advocate or 
support gay marriage, the Assemblies of God stands fi  rmly committed to scriptural 
teaching that marriage is between a man and a woman.
When confronted by actual or potential compromise in other evangelical or Pen-
tecostal fellowships and organizations, steadfast adherence to biblical marriage is 
quickly affi  rmed. The Assemblies of God leadership has been uncompromising it its 
standards of sexual conduct while affi  rming love for all people broken by sin.

[18] OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD!
The evangelical revivals of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries fueled the 
birth of global missions. The Pentecostal awakenings have accelerated the spread 
of the gospel in the twentieth century. We are now witnesses the re-evangelizing of 
Europe and the United States by missional believers from developing nations. The 
gospel is now going from everywhere to everywhere as former missions fi elds become 
missions-sending agencies. 
When Melvin Hodges penned The Indigenous Church in 1953, the aim of missions was 
a self-sustaining local church and, in the long-term, a self-sustaining national fellow-
ship. These remain important goals; however, a more complete goal is emerging in the 
twenty-fi rst century: establishing churches and fellowships of churches that become 
not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around

[19] not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around 
the world answer the Great Commission call and become “360  Churches.” Mission-
ary-scholars such as Alan Johnson in Thailand are now articulating an integration of 
apostolic pioneering and church planting united with holistic care for communities. 
In the post-Christian West, Pentecostal spirituality and theology are the answer 
for generations that are hungry for experience and meaning rooted in love and truth. 
Apologetics and careful explanations of truth must be united with the proclamation 
of the Cross and power of the Spirit to deliver, heal, forgive, redeem, and transform. 
Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The 
signs and wonders demonstrated in Scripture are alive and well on the frontiers of

[20] Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The 
signs and wonders demonstrated in Scripture are alive and well on the frontiers of 
evangelization and missions today. The Assemblies of God has a bright future as we 
recognize those frontiers across the street and around the world.
Gary McGee’s fi nal work, Miracles, Missions and American Pentecostalism (2010), details 
the supernatural confi rmation of the missionary pioneers. As a new Spirit-empowered 
generation hears the call to evangelism, worship, discipleship, and compassion, they 
can expect the Lord of the harvest to again confi  rm the message of grace.

relationship, as to its mode is inscrutable and incomprehensible, because unexplained 
(Luke 1:35; 1 Corinthians 1:24; Matthew 11:25–27; 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14; 1 John 1:3,4).
(c) Unity of the One Being of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
Accordingly, therefore, there is that in the Father which constitutes Him the Father 
and not the Son; there is that in the Son which constitutes Him the Son and not the 
Father; and there is that in the Holy Spirit which constitutes Him the Holy Spirit and 
not either the Father or the Son. Wherefore, the Father is the Begetter; the Son is the 
Begotten; and the Holy Spirit is the One proceeding from the Father and the Son. There-
fore, because these three persons in the godhead are in a state of unity, there is but 
one Lord God Almighty and His name one (John 1:18; 15:26; 17:11,21; Zechariah 14:9).
(d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor

[22] (d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor 
confused as to relation; nor divided in respect to the godhead; nor opposed as to 
cooperation. The Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son as to relationship. 
The Son is with the Father and the Father is with the Son, as to fellowship. The Father 
is not from the Son, but the Son is from the Father, as to authority. The Holy Spirit 
is from the Father and the Son proceeding, as to nature, relationship, cooperation, 
and authority. Hence, no person in the godhead either exists or works separately or 
independently of the others (John 5:17–30,32,37; 8:17,18).
(e) The Title, Lord Jesus Christ
The appellation Lord Jesus Christ, is a proper name. It is never applied in the New 
Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us

[23] Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us
The Lord Jesus Christ, as to His divine and eternal nature, is the proper and only 
Begotten of the Father, but as to His human nature, He is the proper Son of Man. He 
is, therefore, acknowledged to be both God and man; who because He is God and 
man, is “Immanuel,” God with us (Matthew 1:23; 1 John 4:2,10,14; Revelation 1:13,17).
(g) The Title, Son of God
Since the name Immanuel embraces both God and man, in the one person, our 
Lord Jesus Christ, it follows that the title Son of God describes His proper deity, and 
the title Son of Man, His proper humanity. Therefore, the title Son of God belongs to 
the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23; 
2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).
(h) Transgression of the Doctrine of Christ

[24] the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23; 
2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).
(h) Transgression of the Doctrine of Christ
Wherefore, it is a transgression of the doctrine of Christ to say that Jesus Christ 
derived the title Son of God solely from the fact of the Incarnation, or because of His 
relation to the economy of redemption. Therefore, to deny that the Father is a real 
and eternal Father, and that the Son is a real and eternal Son, is a denial of the

a. Conditions to Salvation
Salvation is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord 
Jesus Christ. By the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, being 
justifi ed by grace through faith, man becomes an heir of God according to the hope of 
eternal life (Luke 24:47; John 3:3; Romans 10:13–15; Ephesians 2:8; Titus 2:11; 3:5–7).
b. The Evidences of Salvation
The inward evidence of salvation is the direct witness of the Spirit (Romans 8:16). 
The outward evidence to all men is a life of righteousness and true holiness (Ephe-
sians 4:24; Titus 2:12).

to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with 
Him to walk in newness of life (Matthew 28:19; Mark 16:16; Acts 10:47,48; Romans 6:4).
b. Holy Communion
The Lord’s Supper, consisting of the elements—bread and the fruit of the vine—is 
the symbol expressing our sharing the divine nature of our Lord Jesus Christ (2 Peter 
1:4); a memorial of His suffering and death (1 Corinthians 11:26); and a prophecy of His 
second coming (1 Corinthians 11:26); and is enjoined on all believers “till He come!”
7. THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
All believers are entitled to and should ardently expect and earnestly seek the 
promise of the Father, the baptism in the Holy Spirit and fi  re, according to the com-
mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the

[27] mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the 
bestowment of the gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry (Luke 24:49; Acts 
1:4,8; 1 Corinthians 12:1–31). This experience is distinct from and subsequent to the 
experience of the new birth (Acts 8:12–17; 10:44–46; 11:14–16; 15:7–9). With the bap-
tism in the Holy Spirit come such experiences as an overfl  owing fullness of the Spirit 
(John 7:37–39; Acts 4:8), a deepened reverence for God (Acts 2:43; Hebrews 12:28), an 
intensifi ed consecration to God and dedication to His work (Acts 2:42), and a more 
active love for Christ, for His Word, and for the lost (Mark 16:20).

[28] The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical 
sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts 
2:4). The speaking in tongues in this instance is the same in essence as the gift of 
tongues (1 Corinthians 12:4–10,28), but different in purpose and use.

11. THE MINISTRY
A divinely called and scripturally ordained ministry has been provided by our Lord 
for the fourfold purpose of leading the Church in: (1) evangelization of the world (Mark 
16:15–20), (2) worship of God (John 4:23,24), (3) building a Body of saints being per-
fected in the image of His Son (Ephesians 4:11,16), and (4) meeting human need with 
ministries of love and compassion (Psalm 112:9; Galatians 2:10; 6:10; James 1:27).
12. DIVINE HEALING
Divine healing is an integral part of the gospel. Deliverance from sickness is pro-
vided for in the Atonement, and is the privilege of all believers (Isaiah 53:4,5; Mat-
thew 8:16,17; James 5:14–16).
13. THE BLESSED HOPE
The resurrection of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and their translation 
together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).

[30] together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).
14. THE MILLENNIAL REIGN OF CHRIST
The second coming of Christ includes the rapture of the saints, which is our 
blessed hope, followed by the visible return of Christ with His saints to reign on 
the earth for one thousand years (Zechariah 14:5; Matthew 24:27,30; Revelation 1:7; 
19:11–14; 20:1–6). This millennial reign will bring the salvation of national Israel (Eze-
kiel 37:21,22; Zephaniah 3:19,20; Romans 11:26,27) and the establishment of univer-
sal peace (Isaiah 11:6–9; Psalm 72:3–8; Micah 4:3,4).
15. THE FINAL JUDGMENT
There will be a fi  nal judgment in which the wicked dead will be raised and judged 
according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to

[31] according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to 
everlasting punishment in the lake which burneth with fi  re and brimstone, which is 
the second death (Matthew 25:46; Mark 9:43–48; Revelation 19:20; 20:11–15; 21:8).
16. THE NEW HEAVENS AND THE NEW EARTH
“We, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein 
dwelleth righteousness” (2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 21,22).
Scripture quotations are from the King James Version of the Holy Bible.

try. “People who are poor, sick, and hungry need more than money, health, and food,” 
she wrote in 1990. “Like us all, they need meaning in life—a sense of order, a reason 
for living. This is where Christians have so much to offer. If you help people fi nd the 
meaning of life while helping them fi nd a home or get a job, you are helping them at 
the deepest level.”
ROBERT E. COOLEY 
(1930–)
A number of Assemblies of God scholars like Billie Davis 
have made signifi  cant academic contributions. To the hall of 
fame must be added the name of Robert E. Cooley. He was 
born into a pastor’s home in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and his 
father later served as Michigan district superintendent. In 
1952, he married Eilene Carlson and received ordination from 
the Michigan district six years later.
Academic training for the ministry took him from Central

[2] Educators presented in this chapter include Peter C. Nelson, Myer Pearlman, 
Marcus L. Grable, Christine Gibson, and Stanley H. Frodsham. Gibson, founder of 
the independent Zion Bible Institute in Rhode Island, never held credentials with the 
General Council. Yet hundreds of Assemblies of God ministers received their training 
there; her story deserves to be told. Stanley H. Frodsham, long-time editor of the 
Pentecostal Evangel, has also been included. While he did some teaching at CBI, his 
contributions lie in his editorial work and many books. Through these means, he 
contributed to ministerial preparation formally and informally. Many who couldn’t 
attend the Bible institutes depended on the Evangel for instruction, sermon ideas, 
and Sunday School lessons.
PETER C. NELSON
(1868–1942)
Generally, Pentecostals looked down on academic degrees as more of a hindrance 
than help for Spirit-fi  lled ministry. For example, one early Council leader recalled,

[3] buildings: churches, post offi  ces, government offi  ces, libraries, schools. Since they 
were free and open to the public, each one made a profound impact on her life. Hav-
ing gotten permission from her mother to attend a Sunday School class, Davis heard 
the teacher say that Jesus loved her. Now she had not only sat on a chair for the fi rst 
time, she had found hope. “It was the fi  rst time I saw a way out of the fatalism of 
the campgrounds,” she refl  ected. “The rich get richer, the poor get poorer, everybody 
pushes you down, you don’t have a chance. But in Sunday School they said you did
have a chance, because you’re a child of God.”
Libraries opened a whole new world for her, and the public school promised 
her the same education that every other child received. After Davis’s family settled 
down during World War II, she graduated from high school as the valedictorian of her 
class and began working at an aircraft factory in San Diego. Having edited her high

[4] down during World War II, she graduated from high school as the valedictorian of her 
class and began working at an aircraft factory in San Diego. Having edited her high 
school paper, she dreamed of becoming a journalist and wrote to the national Sun-
day School Department in Springfi  eld. Learning of her interest in writing and editing, 
Marcus Grable invited her to assist with the new Sunday School Counselor magazine.
Only nineteen and having a single change of clothes, she arrived in Springfi eld in 
the early 1940s to collect sixteen dollars a week at headquarters. Giving up plans to 
study at the University of Missouri School of Journalism, she began taking classes at

Drury College (now University). It was during this time that she met George Davis, a 
student at Central Bible College. Married in 1945, she was ordained three years later. 
They went to Costa Rica as missionaries in 1957 and eventually were assigned to pro-
mote Sunday Schools throughout Latin America. With George’s skill as a pilot, they 
fl  ew extensively about the region to workshops and conferences.
Years later, Davis graduated with highest honors from Drury and capped her 
training with a doctorate in education at the University of Miami in Florida. Hoping to 
enter a sociology program, she discovered that the university did not offer a doctor-
ate in that area. Finally, she decided to visit the Education Department to see if they

Cheyney, he immediately remembered her address before the Ohio Education Asso-

her into the department and invited her participation on the project.
While enrolled, she directed a federally funded High School Equivalency Pro-
gram. The Miami Herald reported: “Mrs. Davis and her staff are helping 49 young peo-
ple fi nd their way out of the fi  elds and into a college education, vocational training,

In 1952, the Saturday Evening Post carried her story, “I Was a Hobo Kid.” Readers

come out two years earlier). 
School children across the nation have learned and been inspired by her achieve-
ments and confi  dence in public education. When George and Billie made their res-
idence in Springfi  eld, she served for years as professor of behavioral sciences and

Cooley’s inauguration as president of Gordon-Conwell Theo-
logical Seminary in 1981 marked a milestone in North American 
Pentecostalism. “‘Historic’ . . . seemed a tame term,” mused Rus-
sell P . Spittler, a leading theologian in the Council. “A minister of 
the Assemblies of God becomes the head of a leading evangelical 
seminary reaching the conclusion of its fi  rst century of service.” 
The welding of establishment Pentecostalism to evangelicalism, 
which had begun in 1942 with membership in the National Asso-
ciation of Evangelicals, appeared complete.
After retirement as president, Cooley was named chancellor

dents on immigration issues and faith-based organizations, and executive presbyter 
of the Assemblies of God, Miranda has a distinguished record of service to church

Miranda grew up in an unpromising environment: a poor barrio in Albuquerque, 
New Mexico, one of fi ve children born to a sawmill worker who had emigrated from 
Chihuahua State in Mexico and a mother of Spanish descent. He came to Christ at 
an early age after members of a nearby Pentecostal church, who had heard that his 
mother was sick, came to the house and prayed for her. Her healing had a dramatic 
effect on the family and young Jesse. 
The church had been in contact with the family for two years before the healing. 
“This little Pentecostal church would come in an old broken-down-bus, pick us up, 
and take me to church—that made the difference,” Miranda recalled. It was at church 
that he learned to write. At Christmastime, when his parents gave clothes as presents

While growing up, the disciplined lifestyle of his father and the spiritual encour-
agement of his mother strongly infl  uenced him. On one occasion, during a church

become an educated man. She then pointed to a man kneeling at the altar in prayer 
as an example: Joe E. Martinez, an Assemblies of God layman and professor at the 
University of New Mexico. “That’s the image that stuck.”

[15] His parents—a Catholic father and mainline Protestant mother—also mentored 
him in the importance of reconciliation. “I remember I was 13 or 14, and I said, ‘Dad, 
Catholics never read the Bible,’ because I never saw him read it. ‘Mother, you read the 
Bible but never come to the book of Acts.’ And then they would turn around and say, 
‘And you Pentecostals never leave the Book of Acts.’ So I saw my shortcomings and 
I saw differences. Yet we loved and respected one another so that we really enjoyed 
our fellowship. And we all affi  rmed one another.” 
At age sixteen, he began to attend Bible school, and his pastor assigned him 
preaching responsibilities a year later. Like other young people who demonstrated 
leadership abilities in Pentecostal churches, his pastor gave him opportunities to

n late summer 1930, William I. Evans, the “principal” of Central Bible Institute 
(CBI) announced that the school year would begin on September 26, and there 
was still room for more students. “We are looking for Jesus to come and, in conse-
quence of that glorious event, we may never conduct the [term],” he remarked. “We 
thank God for the blessed hope. . . . However, we are occupying till He comes. That 
occupation with us is making this Institute count for the very most in the advance-
ment of the Kingdom.” The school preferred mature and “diligent students of the 
Word,” nineteen years of age and older. Accepting applicants below this age might 
mean that at graduation three years later, they could still be “too young to be trusted 
with the responsibilities involved.”

[20] Evans lamented that fi  nding students with the “highest type of consecration 
among us is getting rarer.” Life at a Bible institute contrasted sharply with campus 
life at colleges and universities. Preeminently an experience in spiritual formation, it 
demanded a high level of dedication to stay the course.
The “standards of holiness” required separation from worldly values. “It grieves 
our hearts and we could weep,” he added in disappointment, “when we see world 
conformity among Bible school graduates!” Women especially seem to have been 
the culprits: “We have seen pastors’ wives and lady pastors and leaders dressed so 
much like the world as to show no line of separation.” Hence, “short skirts, low necks, 
sheer clothes, adornments, and worldly style of hair dress, are inexcusable. Certainly 
religion does not consist in what we wear, but genuine religion of the kind we profess 
will show itself in these matters.” Hopefully, “only . . . serious-minded youths will

[21] religion does not consist in what we wear, but genuine religion of the kind we profess 
will show itself in these matters.” Hopefully, “only . . . serious-minded youths will 
care to apply themselves to [the school’s] rigor.” 
Although strict discipline characterized all the schools, the atmosphere could 
hardly be described as dull or without humor. Instead, both students and faculty 
members shared a common commitment for the evangelization of the world. Refl ect-
ing the desire of church leaders and grassroots believers alike, Evans pleaded, “We 
want all its facilities from walls and roof to the services of consecrated instructors to 
produce the very utmost in lives for the Kingdom.”

[22] PEOPLE OF THE SPIRIT
Alumni from Assemblies of God schools often recall classroom instructors who 
profoundly impacted their lives. Since these institutions were ventures of faith, fac-
ulty members worked long hours, struggled with low pay, and frequently received lit-
tle recognition for their sacrifi cial efforts. In a report published in the Pentecostal Evan-
gel about the 1937 commencement at Latin American Bible Institute in San Antonio 
and the thirty-fi  ve men and women who graduated, the writer attributed the success 
of the school to the sacrifi  ces of the staff: “Much credit is due to Brother Ball and the 
group of workers who have been assisting him as teachers in the school, since funds 
have never been very plentiful so as to enable anyone to be really remunerated for 
his services; but each has given his time and effort willingly as unto the Lord, trusting 
God for the supply of his individual needs.”

[23] his services; but each has given his time and effort willingly as unto the Lord, trusting 
God for the supply of his individual needs.”
Most churches did not fi  nancially support these schools for several reasons: 
First, they sometimes preferred spending their monies on local church ministries 
and/or foreign missions. Second, a long-standing fear of educational preparation 
made many wary of Bible institutes. Third, since the schools operated on faith, God 
would somehow provide for them; indeed, strong fi  nancial backing might jeopardize 
their spiritual vigor. Despite the handicaps that worked against their effectiveness, 
teachers contributed heavily to the spiritual formation of thousands of pastors, evan-
gelists, missionaries, and other church workers.

condition at the homes of the students will prevent many of them from coming to school

yield good dividends in the Kingdom of God. Offerings may be sent to the Foreign Mis-

Bryant’s infl  uence. Enrolling at a Baptist seminary in the Chicago area a year later, he 
found that without an undergraduate degree he was not prepared, so he switched to 
Denison University in Ohio. To cover his expenses, he worked as a manual laborer. 
While there he met his wife, Myrtle Garmong, who then helped him complete the 
program (in seven years).
Still feeling unprepared, he enrolled at Rochester Seminary in 1899. Augustus 
H. Strong, the president and professor of theology, taught the courses in systematic 
theology, and Nelson became one of his students. Strong’s Systematic Theology, fi  rst 
published in 1886, had gone through seven editions and reached nearly twelve hun-
dred pages by the time he got there. “I have discarded none of the Baptist  doctrines,” 
he reminisced many years later, “but have built a story or two on the good solid foun-

[28] he reminisced many years later, “but have built a story or two on the good solid foun-
dation laid for our faith.”
Following graduation, he evangelized and pastored several churches before 
being called to pastor Conley Memorial Baptist Church in Detroit. His contact with 
Pentecostals began in 1920, but they failed to impress him. Nevertheless, a healing 
from a serious and possibly life-threatening infection led him to begin preaching on 
divine healing. But the congregation refused to accept this new teaching, and before 
long he resigned. Shortly after, he was baptized in the Spirit and joined the Assem-
blies of God. 
By now over fi  fty years old and a seasoned minister, he detected that many young 
people in the Assemblies of God were entering the ministry just like he had: with little 
preparation. In 1927 he moved to Enid, Oklahoma, where he founded a church and

known. Before his death, Southwestern Bible School merged with two other schools

MYER PEARLMAN
(1898–1943)
The personalities in this chapter came from widely different backgrounds, and 
Myer Pearlman was no exception. The eldest son of a 
Jewish family, he studied at a synagogue school in Bir-
mingham, England. In school he remembered learning 
the Jewish version of the three R’s: the Jewish faith, the 
Torah (Old Testament), and the Hebrew language. “I was 
taught,” he recalled, “that while I  was to be a patriotic 
Englishman, I was also a Jew, a member of the nation, and 
that I was different from other people. I remember passing 
meat markets, and inwardly thanking God that I did not 
eat unclean meat.”
The economic situation in England forced his  father 
to move the family to the United States in hopes of gain-

[32] meat markets, and inwardly thanking God that I did not 
eat unclean meat.”
The economic situation in England forced his  father 
to move the family to the United States in hopes of gain-
ing employment and improving their living standard. After settling in New York City in 
1915, the younger Pearlman eventually enlisted in the U.S. Army and served eighteen 
months in the medical corps in France. His profi ciency in French helped him in this 
capacity. After the war, he traveled to California where “groping for light I began to 
read religious books and attend services.” 
Sometime later, walking by a mission in San Francisco, he noticed a crowd gath-
ered at the entrance and stopped to listen to the music. On another evening, he 
stood outside again. Mustering his courage, he entered and took a seat. He was par-
ticularly impressed by the music, especially the song “Honey in the Rock,” written by 
F.A. Graves. Based on Deuteronomy 32:13 (“he nourished [Israel] with honey from

[33] ticularly impressed by the music, especially the song “Honey in the Rock,” written by 
F.A. Graves. Based on Deuteronomy 32:13 (“he nourished [Israel] with honey from 
the rock”), it tells of God’s grace and provision from an unexpected source. Verse two 
asks, “Have you ‘tasted that the Lord is gracious?’ Do you walk in the way that’s new? 
Have you drunk from the living fountain? There’s Honey in the Rock [Jesus Christ] 
for you.” Attending nightly, he eventually confessed his sins and became a Christian, 
praying “in the name of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.”
In 1922, Pearlman enrolled at Central Bible Institute, where he later met 
his wife, Irene Graves, daughter of the songwriter. A brilliant student and self-
taught in many areas, he read the Scriptures in Hebrew, Greek, Spanish, French, 
and Italian. At graduation time, the principal, Frank M. Boyd, invited him to join 
the faculty. Pearlman accepted and taught there from 1924 until his death in 1943.

try. “People who are poor, sick, and hungry need more than money, health, and food,” 
she wrote in 1990. “Like us all, they need meaning in life—a sense of order, a reason 
for living. This is where Christians have so much to offer. If you help people fi nd the

the deepest level.”
ROBERT E. COOLEY 
(1930–)
A number of Assemblies of God scholars like Billie Davis 
have made signifi  cant academic contributions. To the hall of 
fame must be added the name of Robert E. Cooley. He was 
born into a pastor’s home in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and his 
father later served as Michigan district superintendent. In 
1952, he married Eilene Carlson and received ordination from 
the Michigan district six years later.
Academic training for the ministry took him from Central

[2] Educators presented in this chapter include Peter C. Nelson, Myer Pearlman, 
Marcus L. Grable, Christine Gibson, and Stanley H. Frodsham. Gibson, founder of 
the independent Zion Bible Institute in Rhode Island, never held credentials with the 
General Council. Yet hundreds of Assemblies of God ministers received their training 
there; her story deserves to be told. Stanley H. Frodsham, long-time editor of the 
Pentecostal Evangel, has also been included. While he did some teaching at CBI, his 
contributions lie in his editorial work and many books. Through these means, he 
contributed to ministerial preparation formally and informally. Many who couldn’t 
attend the Bible institutes depended on the Evangel for instruction, sermon ideas, 
and Sunday School lessons.
PETER C. NELSON
(1868–1942)
Generally, Pentecostals looked down on academic degrees as more of a hindrance 
than help for Spirit-fi  lled ministry. For example, one early Council leader recalled,

[3] buildings: churches, post offi  ces, government offi  ces, libraries, schools. Since they 
were free and open to the public, each one made a profound impact on her life. Hav-
ing gotten permission from her mother to attend a Sunday School class, Davis heard 
the teacher say that Jesus loved her. Now she had not only sat on a chair for the fi rst 
time, she had found hope. “It was the fi  rst time I saw a way out of the fatalism of 
the campgrounds,” she refl  ected. “The rich get richer, the poor get poorer, everybody 
pushes you down, you don’t have a chance. But in Sunday School they said you did
have a chance, because you’re a child of God.”
Libraries opened a whole new world for her, and the public school promised 
her the same education that every other child received. After Davis’s family settled 
down during World War II, she graduated from high school as the valedictorian of her 
class and began working at an aircraft factory in San Diego. Having edited her high

class and began working at an aircraft factory in San Diego. Having edited her high 
school paper, she dreamed of becoming a journalist and wrote to the national Sun-
day School Department in Springfi  eld. Learning of her interest in writing and editing, 
Marcus Grable invited her to assist with the new Sunday School Counselor magazine.
Only nineteen and having a single change of clothes, she arrived in Springfi eld in 
the early 1940s to collect sixteen dollars a week at headquarters. Giving up plans to 
study at the University of Missouri School of Journalism, she began taking classes at

Drury College (now University). It was during this time that she met George Davis, a 
student at Central Bible College. Married in 1945, she was ordained three years later. 
They went to Costa Rica as missionaries in 1957 and eventually were assigned to pro-
mote Sunday Schools throughout Latin America. With George’s skill as a pilot, they 
fl  ew extensively about the region to workshops and conferences.
Years later, Davis graduated with highest honors from Drury and capped her 
training with a doctorate in education at the University of Miami in Florida. Hoping to 
enter a sociology program, she discovered that the university did not offer a doctor-
ate in that area. Finally, she decided to visit the Education Department to see if they

In 1952, the Saturday Evening Post carried her story, “I Was a Hobo Kid.” Readers

Cooley’s inauguration as president of Gordon-Conwell Theo-
logical Seminary in 1981 marked a milestone in North American 
Pentecostalism. “‘Historic’ . . . seemed a tame term,” mused Rus-
sell P . Spittler, a leading theologian in the Council. “A minister of 
the Assemblies of God becomes the head of a leading evangelical 
seminary reaching the conclusion of its fi  rst century of service.” 
The welding of establishment Pentecostalism to evangelicalism, 
which had begun in 1942 with membership in the National Asso-

Miranda grew up in an unpromising environment: a poor barrio in Albuquerque, 
New Mexico, one of fi ve children born to a sawmill worker who had emigrated from 
Chihuahua State in Mexico and a mother of Spanish descent. He came to Christ at 
an early age after members of a nearby Pentecostal church, who had heard that his 
mother was sick, came to the house and prayed for her. Her healing had a dramatic 
effect on the family and young Jesse. 
The church had been in contact with the family for two years before the healing. 
“This little Pentecostal church would come in an old broken-down-bus, pick us up, 
and take me to church—that made the difference,” Miranda recalled. It was at church 
that he learned to write. At Christmastime, when his parents gave clothes as presents

While growing up, the disciplined lifestyle of his father and the spiritual encour-

service, his mother put her arm around him and told him that she wanted him to 
become an educated man. She then pointed to a man kneeling at the altar in prayer 
as an example: Joe E. Martinez, an Assemblies of God layman and professor at the 
University of New Mexico. “That’s the image that stuck.”

[15] His parents—a Catholic father and mainline Protestant mother—also mentored 
him in the importance of reconciliation. “I remember I was 13 or 14, and I said, ‘Dad, 
Catholics never read the Bible,’ because I never saw him read it. ‘Mother, you read the 
Bible but never come to the book of Acts.’ And then they would turn around and say, 
‘And you Pentecostals never leave the Book of Acts.’ So I saw my shortcomings and 
I saw differences. Yet we loved and respected one another so that we really enjoyed 
our fellowship. And we all affi  rmed one another.” 
At age sixteen, he began to attend Bible school, and his pastor assigned him 
preaching responsibilities a year later. Like other young people who demonstrated 
leadership abilities in Pentecostal churches, his pastor gave him opportunities to

n late summer 1930, William I. Evans, the “principal” of Central Bible Institute 
(CBI) announced that the school year would begin on September 26, and there 
was still room for more students. “We are looking for Jesus to come and, in conse-
quence of that glorious event, we may never conduct the [term],” he remarked. “We 
thank God for the blessed hope. . . . However, we are occupying till He comes. That 
occupation with us is making this Institute count for the very most in the advance-
ment of the Kingdom.” The school preferred mature and “diligent students of the 
Word,” nineteen years of age and older. Accepting applicants below this age might 
mean that at graduation three years later, they could still be “too young to be trusted 
with the responsibilities involved.”

[20] Evans lamented that fi  nding students with the “highest type of consecration 
among us is getting rarer.” Life at a Bible institute contrasted sharply with campus 
life at colleges and universities. Preeminently an experience in spiritual formation, it 
demanded a high level of dedication to stay the course.
The “standards of holiness” required separation from worldly values. “It grieves 
our hearts and we could weep,” he added in disappointment, “when we see world 
conformity among Bible school graduates!” Women especially seem to have been 
the culprits: “We have seen pastors’ wives and lady pastors and leaders dressed so 
much like the world as to show no line of separation.” Hence, “short skirts, low necks, 
sheer clothes, adornments, and worldly style of hair dress, are inexcusable. Certainly 
religion does not consist in what we wear, but genuine religion of the kind we profess

[21] religion does not consist in what we wear, but genuine religion of the kind we profess 
will show itself in these matters.” Hopefully, “only . . . serious-minded youths will 
care to apply themselves to [the school’s] rigor.” 
Although strict discipline characterized all the schools, the atmosphere could 
hardly be described as dull or without humor. Instead, both students and faculty 
members shared a common commitment for the evangelization of the world. Refl ect-
ing the desire of church leaders and grassroots believers alike, Evans pleaded, “We 
want all its facilities from walls and roof to the services of consecrated instructors to 
produce the very utmost in lives for the Kingdom.”

[22] PEOPLE OF THE SPIRIT
Alumni from Assemblies of God schools often recall classroom instructors who 
profoundly impacted their lives. Since these institutions were ventures of faith, fac-
ulty members worked long hours, struggled with low pay, and frequently received lit-
tle recognition for their sacrifi cial efforts. In a report published in the Pentecostal Evan-
gel about the 1937 commencement at Latin American Bible Institute in San Antonio 
and the thirty-fi  ve men and women who graduated, the writer attributed the success 
of the school to the sacrifi  ces of the staff: “Much credit is due to Brother Ball and the 
group of workers who have been assisting him as teachers in the school, since funds 
have never been very plentiful so as to enable anyone to be really remunerated for 
his services; but each has given his time and effort willingly as unto the Lord, trusting 
God for the supply of his individual needs.”

[23] his services; but each has given his time and effort willingly as unto the Lord, trusting 
God for the supply of his individual needs.”
Most churches did not fi  nancially support these schools for several reasons: 
First, they sometimes preferred spending their monies on local church ministries 
and/or foreign missions. Second, a long-standing fear of educational preparation 
made many wary of Bible institutes. Third, since the schools operated on faith, God 
would somehow provide for them; indeed, strong fi  nancial backing might jeopardize 
their spiritual vigor. Despite the handicaps that worked against their effectiveness, 
teachers contributed heavily to the spiritual formation of thousands of pastors, evan-
gelists, missionaries, and other church workers.

Bryant’s infl  uence. Enrolling at a Baptist seminary in the Chicago area a year later, he 
found that without an undergraduate degree he was not prepared, so he switched to 
Denison University in Ohio. To cover his expenses, he worked as a manual laborer. 
While there he met his wife, Myrtle Garmong, who then helped him complete the 
program (in seven years).
Still feeling unprepared, he enrolled at Rochester Seminary in 1899. Augustus 
H. Strong, the president and professor of theology, taught the courses in systematic 
theology, and Nelson became one of his students. Strong’s Systematic Theology, fi  rst 
published in 1886, had gone through seven editions and reached nearly twelve hun-
dred pages by the time he got there. “I have discarded none of the Baptist  doctrines,” 
he reminisced many years later, “but have built a story or two on the good solid foun-
dation laid for our faith.”

[28] he reminisced many years later, “but have built a story or two on the good solid foun-
dation laid for our faith.”
Following graduation, he evangelized and pastored several churches before 
being called to pastor Conley Memorial Baptist Church in Detroit. His contact with 
Pentecostals began in 1920, but they failed to impress him. Nevertheless, a healing 
from a serious and possibly life-threatening infection led him to begin preaching on 
divine healing. But the congregation refused to accept this new teaching, and before 
long he resigned. Shortly after, he was baptized in the Spirit and joined the Assem-
blies of God. 
By now over fi  fty years old and a seasoned minister, he detected that many young 
people in the Assemblies of God were entering the ministry just like he had: with little 
preparation. In 1927 he moved to Enid, Oklahoma, where he founded a church and

recognized the need for Pentecostal curricular materials. This led him to write several 
books, including The Young Minister’s Guide (1932) and Bible Doctrines (1934), his best 
known. Before his death, Southwestern Bible School merged with two other schools

missionary service, to come forward, and ﬁ  fty-ﬁ ve responded. The missionary spirit 
in Southwestern has been growing, and many are now ready to go to distant lands as 
soon as they can be sent forth.

MYER PEARLMAN
(1898–1943)
The personalities in this chapter came from widely different backgrounds, and 
Myer Pearlman was no exception. The eldest son of a 
Jewish family, he studied at a synagogue school in Bir-
mingham, England. In school he remembered learning 
the Jewish version of the three R’s: the Jewish faith, the 
Torah (Old Testament), and the Hebrew language. “I was 
taught,” he recalled, “that while I  was to be a patriotic 
Englishman, I was also a Jew, a member of the nation, and 
that I was different from other people. I remember passing 
meat markets, and inwardly thanking God that I did not 
eat unclean meat.”
The economic situation in England forced his  father 
to move the family to the United States in hopes of gain-

[32] meat markets, and inwardly thanking God that I did not 
eat unclean meat.”
The economic situation in England forced his  father 
to move the family to the United States in hopes of gain-
ing employment and improving their living standard. After settling in New York City in 
1915, the younger Pearlman eventually enlisted in the U.S. Army and served eighteen 
months in the medical corps in France. His profi ciency in French helped him in this 
capacity. After the war, he traveled to California where “groping for light I began to 
read religious books and attend services.” 
Sometime later, walking by a mission in San Francisco, he noticed a crowd gath-
ered at the entrance and stopped to listen to the music. On another evening, he 
stood outside again. Mustering his courage, he entered and took a seat. He was par-
ticularly impressed by the music, especially the song “Honey in the Rock,” written by 
F.A. Graves. Based on Deuteronomy 32:13 (“he nourished [Israel] with honey from

[33] ticularly impressed by the music, especially the song “Honey in the Rock,” written by 
F.A. Graves. Based on Deuteronomy 32:13 (“he nourished [Israel] with honey from 
the rock”), it tells of God’s grace and provision from an unexpected source. Verse two 
asks, “Have you ‘tasted that the Lord is gracious?’ Do you walk in the way that’s new? 
Have you drunk from the living fountain? There’s Honey in the Rock [Jesus Christ] 
for you.” Attending nightly, he eventually confessed his sins and became a Christian, 
praying “in the name of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.”
In 1922, Pearlman enrolled at Central Bible Institute, where he later met 
his wife, Irene Graves, daughter of the songwriter. A brilliant student and self-
taught in many areas, he read the Scriptures in Hebrew, Greek, Spanish, French, 
and Italian. At graduation time, the principal, Frank M. Boyd, invited him to join 
the faculty. Pearlman accepted and taught there from 1924 until his death in 1943.

materials for Gospel Publishing House to earn additional money. Before long,

[35] dice and to reconcile social antagonism. The church may offer the world a privatized, 
personal, and ‘spiritual’ brand of Christianity, or it can provide leadership toward a 
more just and humane society exemplifying the kingdom of God.”
Christianity Today noted, “Since the days of playing in backyard junk cars [in the 
barrio], he has not stopped envisioning a better future. Now, he says, his dream is 
that his children and grandchildren will live and work among a broader Christian 
community as a result of his bridge-building.”
The varied endeavors of the persons introduced in this chapter represent the 
notable work of Christian mentors. Paul, too, recognized the value of mentoring when 
he advised his understudy Timothy to “be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus; 
and what you have heard from me through many witnesses entrust to faithful people 
who will be able to teach others as well” (2 Timothy 2:1–2, NRSV).

Over the course of years, he authored three books, wrote hundreds of articles for 
the Evangel and other headquarters’ publications, and became a popular speaker at 
writers’ conferences around the world. Like the Old Testament prophet Habakkuk, he 
told his staff, as well as aspiring writers, that the nature of their work required them 
to “write the vision, and make it plain” (Habakkuk 2:2).
Those who knew Champion remember his ability to affi  rm those with whom he 
worked. When staffers submitted poor articles, he would meet with them person-
ally and review the problems. They would not only leave knowing how to make the 
needed changes, but also feeling positive about themselves and their skills. Friends 
also remember his keen wit.

9. SANCTIFICATION
Sanctifi cation is an act of separation from that which is evil, and of dedication 
unto God (Romans 12:1,2; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; Hebrews 13:12). Scriptures teach a 
life of “holiness without which no man shall see the Lord” (Hebrews 12:14). By the 
power of the Holy Spirit we are able to obey the command: “Be ye holy, for I am holy” 
(1 Peter 1:15,16).
Sanctifi cation is realized in the believer by recognizing his identifi  cation with 
Christ in His death and resurrection, and by faith reckoning daily upon the fact of that 
union, and by offering every faculty continually to the dominion of the Holy Spirit 
(Romans 6:1–11,13; 8:1,2,13; Galatians 2:20; Philippians 2:12,13; 1 Peter 1:5).
10. THE CHURCH AND ITS MISSION
The Church is the body of Christ, the habitation of God through the Spirit, with 
divine appointments for the fulfi  llment of her Great Commission. Each believer, born

T
he Bible is our all–suffi  cient rule for faith and practice. This Statement of Fun-
damental Truths is intended simply as a basis of fellowship among us (i.e., that 
we all speak the same thing, 1 Corinthians 1:10; Acts 2:42). The phraseology 
employed in this statement is not inspired or contended for, but the truth set forth 
is held to be essential to a full–gospel ministry. No claim is made that it contains all 
biblical truth, only that it covers our need as to these fundamental doctrines.
1. THE SCRIPTURES INSPIRED
The Scriptures, both the Old and New Testaments, are verbally inspired of God 
and are the revelation of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and 
conduct (2 Timothy 3:15–17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Peter 1:21).
2. THE ONE TRUE GOD
The one true God has revealed himself as the eternally self–existent “I AM,” the 
Creator of heaven and earth and the Redeemer of mankind. He has further revealed

[3] a. His virgin birth (Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:31,35). 
b. His sinless life (Hebrews 7:26; 1 Peter 2:22).
c. His miracles (Acts 2:22; 10:38).
d. His substitutionary work on the cross (1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
e. His bodily resurrection from the dead (Matthew 28:6; Luke 24:39; 1 Corinthians 
15:4).
f. His exaltation to the right hand of God (Acts 1:9,11; 2:33; Philippians 2:9–11; 
Hebrews 1:3).
4. THE FALL OF MAN
Man was created good and upright; for God said, “Let us make man in our 
image, after our likeness.” However, man by voluntary transgression fell and thereby 
incurred not only physical death but also spiritual death, which is separation from 
God (Genesis 1:26,27; 2:17; 3:6; Romans 5:12–19).
5. THE SALVATION OF MAN
Man’s only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son 
of God.

Articles 10 and 11 of the Statement of Fundamental Truths.

of a generation of Assemblies of God “post-Pentecostal Pen-
tecostals” that affi  rm the Statement of Fundamental Truths 
and enjoy relationships, but do not seek to practice or pro-
mote Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues.
General Superintendent Wood disputes this pessimistic 
picture in a 2014 centennial interview in Charisma magazine. 
His observations, interviews with leaders, and wide travel 
affi rm that Spirit baptism with the initial physical evidence of 
tongues is alive and growing. He affi  rmed that the statistics 
are imperfect, not refl  ecting practices in thousands of churches in recent years.

[6] notes a signifi cant rise in Pentecostal practices, even among those not tradition-
ally labeled Pentecostal or charismatic. For much the evangelical world in particular, 
praying for healing and miracles, exercising spiritual gifts, trusting the Lord for deliv-
erance, and speaking in tongues are all valid biblical practices. This is a signifi  cant 
change within one generation. 
Cessationism (the belief that the manifestations of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians 
12–14 ceased with the death of the original apostles or the close of the New Testa-
ment canon in the fourth century) is a declining movement as believers of all denom-
inations and theological persuasions affi  rm the contemporary work of the Spirit. 
Though many of these groups do not share the “classical” Pentecostal distinctive 
of tongues as the initial physical evident of Spirit baptism, the affi  rmation that the

[7] of tongues as the initial physical evident of Spirit baptism, the affi  rmation that the 
Spirit works in and through all the gifts is a heartening change. 
There are some signs across the United States that cause concern among 
thoughtful persons. The number of people that answered “none” when asked for reli-
gious affi  liation has grown from a miniscule percentage in the 1980s to 16.1  per-
cent in a 2007 poll by Pew Research. And 28 percent have left the faith they were 
raised in or affi  liate with no religion at all.
1 This refl  ects two trends: (1) the loss of 
denominational loyalty among some that might still (vaguely) identify themselves as 
Christians; and (2) an increasing number of the U.S. population (both immigrant and 
native-born) with no religious affi liation.

[8] “Post-Christian” and “postmodern” are labels tossed about with great frequency 
in popular analysis. The United States remains much more religious than most of 
Western Europe; however, “being spiritual and not religious” is gaining as a category 
of a generation without signifi  cant exposure to the gospel. 
The new challenge for Assemblies of God leaders is evangelization of people with 
no Christian memory. This is a new phenomenon for many U.S. leaders (though not 
for the appointed missionaries of AGWM). 
Another concern among thoughtful adherents is moral compromise with the 
subversion of traditional marriage and sexuality in the last half-century. The public

consensus in the West and the United States of lifelong heterosexual marriage and 
celibacy for singles is no longer the prevailing opinion of popular culture or even 
a majority of people. While strong elements within American society advocate or 
support gay marriage, the Assemblies of God stands fi  rmly committed to scriptural 
teaching that marriage is between a man and a woman.
When confronted by actual or potential compromise in other evangelical or Pen-
tecostal fellowships and organizations, steadfast adherence to biblical marriage is 
quickly affi  rmed. The Assemblies of God leadership has been uncompromising it its 
standards of sexual conduct while affi  rming love for all people broken by sin.

[10] OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD!
The evangelical revivals of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries fueled the 
birth of global missions. The Pentecostal awakenings have accelerated the spread 
of the gospel in the twentieth century. We are now witnesses the re-evangelizing of 
Europe and the United States by missional believers from developing nations. The 
gospel is now going from everywhere to everywhere as former missions fi elds become 
missions-sending agencies. 
When Melvin Hodges penned The Indigenous Church in 1953, the aim of missions was 
a self-sustaining local church and, in the long-term, a self-sustaining national fellow-
ship. These remain important goals; however, a more complete goal is emerging in the 
twenty-fi rst century: establishing churches and fellowships of churches that become 
not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata,

[11] not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around 
the world answer the Great Commission call and become “360  Churches.” Mission-
ary-scholars such as Alan Johnson in Thailand are now articulating an integration of 
apostolic pioneering and church planting united with holistic care for communities. 
In the post-Christian West, Pentecostal spirituality and theology are the answer 
for generations that are hungry for experience and meaning rooted in love and truth. 
Apologetics and careful explanations of truth must be united with the proclamation 
of the Cross and power of the Spirit to deliver, heal, forgive, redeem, and transform.

[12] Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The 
signs and wonders demonstrated in Scripture are alive and well on the frontiers of 
evangelization and missions today. The Assemblies of God has a bright future as we 
recognize those frontiers across the street and around the world.
Gary McGee’s fi nal work, Miracles, Missions and American Pentecostalism (2010), details 
the supernatural confi rmation of the missionary pioneers. As a new Spirit-empowered 
generation hears the call to evangelism, worship, discipleship, and compassion, they 
can expect the Lord of the harvest to again confi  rm the message of grace.

relationship, as to its mode is inscrutable and incomprehensible, because unexplained 
(Luke 1:35; 1 Corinthians 1:24; Matthew 11:25–27; 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14; 1 John 1:3,4).
(c) Unity of the One Being of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
Accordingly, therefore, there is that in the Father which constitutes Him the Father 
and not the Son; there is that in the Son which constitutes Him the Son and not the 
Father; and there is that in the Holy Spirit which constitutes Him the Holy Spirit and 
not either the Father or the Son. Wherefore, the Father is the Begetter; the Son is the 
Begotten; and the Holy Spirit is the One proceeding from the Father and the Son. There-
fore, because these three persons in the godhead are in a state of unity, there is but 
one Lord God Almighty and His name one (John 1:18; 15:26; 17:11,21; Zechariah 14:9).
(d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor

[14] (d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor 
confused as to relation; nor divided in respect to the godhead; nor opposed as to 
cooperation. The Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son as to relationship. 
The Son is with the Father and the Father is with the Son, as to fellowship. The Father 
is not from the Son, but the Son is from the Father, as to authority. The Holy Spirit 
is from the Father and the Son proceeding, as to nature, relationship, cooperation, 
and authority. Hence, no person in the godhead either exists or works separately or 
independently of the others (John 5:17–30,32,37; 8:17,18).
(e) The Title, Lord Jesus Christ
The appellation Lord Jesus Christ, is a proper name. It is never applied in the New 
Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us

[15] Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us
The Lord Jesus Christ, as to His divine and eternal nature, is the proper and only 
Begotten of the Father, but as to His human nature, He is the proper Son of Man. He 
is, therefore, acknowledged to be both God and man; who because He is God and 
man, is “Immanuel,” God with us (Matthew 1:23; 1 John 4:2,10,14; Revelation 1:13,17).
(g) The Title, Son of God
Since the name Immanuel embraces both God and man, in the one person, our 
Lord Jesus Christ, it follows that the title Son of God describes His proper deity, and 
the title Son of Man, His proper humanity. Therefore, the title Son of God belongs to 
the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23; 
2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).
(h) Transgression of the Doctrine of Christ

[16] the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23; 
2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).
(h) Transgression of the Doctrine of Christ
Wherefore, it is a transgression of the doctrine of Christ to say that Jesus Christ 
derived the title Son of God solely from the fact of the Incarnation, or because of His 
relation to the economy of redemption. Therefore, to deny that the Father is a real 
and eternal Father, and that the Son is a real and eternal Son, is a denial of the

a. Conditions to Salvation
Salvation is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord 
Jesus Christ. By the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, being 
justifi ed by grace through faith, man becomes an heir of God according to the hope of 
eternal life (Luke 24:47; John 3:3; Romans 10:13–15; Ephesians 2:8; Titus 2:11; 3:5–7).
b. The Evidences of Salvation
The inward evidence of salvation is the direct witness of the Spirit (Romans 8:16). 
The outward evidence to all men is a life of righteousness and true holiness (Ephe-
sians 4:24; Titus 2:12).
 6. THE ORDINANCES OF THE CHURCH
a. Baptism in Water
The ordinance of baptism by immersion is commanded in the Scriptures. All who 
repent and believe on Christ as Savior and Lord are to be baptized. Thus they declare 
to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with

[18] repent and believe on Christ as Savior and Lord are to be baptized. Thus they declare 
to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with 
Him to walk in newness of life (Matthew 28:19; Mark 16:16; Acts 10:47,48; Romans 6:4).
b. Holy Communion
The Lord’s Supper, consisting of the elements—bread and the fruit of the vine—is 
the symbol expressing our sharing the divine nature of our Lord Jesus Christ (2 Peter 
1:4); a memorial of His suffering and death (1 Corinthians 11:26); and a prophecy of His 
second coming (1 Corinthians 11:26); and is enjoined on all believers “till He come!”
7. THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
All believers are entitled to and should ardently expect and earnestly seek the 
promise of the Father, the baptism in the Holy Spirit and fi  re, according to the com-
mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the

[19] mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the 
bestowment of the gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry (Luke 24:49; Acts 
1:4,8; 1 Corinthians 12:1–31). This experience is distinct from and subsequent to the 
experience of the new birth (Acts 8:12–17; 10:44–46; 11:14–16; 15:7–9). With the bap-
tism in the Holy Spirit come such experiences as an overfl  owing fullness of the Spirit 
(John 7:37–39; Acts 4:8), a deepened reverence for God (Acts 2:43; Hebrews 12:28), an 
intensifi ed consecration to God and dedication to His work (Acts 2:42), and a more 
active love for Christ, for His Word, and for the lost (Mark 16:20).
8. THE INITIAL PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical 
sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts

[20] The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical 
sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts 
2:4). The speaking in tongues in this instance is the same in essence as the gift of 
tongues (1 Corinthians 12:4–10,28), but different in purpose and use.

11. THE MINISTRY
A divinely called and scripturally ordained ministry has been provided by our Lord 
for the fourfold purpose of leading the Church in: (1) evangelization of the world (Mark 
16:15–20), (2) worship of God (John 4:23,24), (3) building a Body of saints being per-
fected in the image of His Son (Ephesians 4:11,16), and (4) meeting human need with 
ministries of love and compassion (Psalm 112:9; Galatians 2:10; 6:10; James 1:27).
12. DIVINE HEALING
Divine healing is an integral part of the gospel. Deliverance from sickness is pro-
vided for in the Atonement, and is the privilege of all believers (Isaiah 53:4,5; Mat-
thew 8:16,17; James 5:14–16).
13. THE BLESSED HOPE
The resurrection of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and their translation 
together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).

[22] together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).
14. THE MILLENNIAL REIGN OF CHRIST
The second coming of Christ includes the rapture of the saints, which is our 
blessed hope, followed by the visible return of Christ with His saints to reign on 
the earth for one thousand years (Zechariah 14:5; Matthew 24:27,30; Revelation 1:7; 
19:11–14; 20:1–6). This millennial reign will bring the salvation of national Israel (Eze-
kiel 37:21,22; Zephaniah 3:19,20; Romans 11:26,27) and the establishment of univer-
sal peace (Isaiah 11:6–9; Psalm 72:3–8; Micah 4:3,4).
15. THE FINAL JUDGMENT
There will be a fi  nal judgment in which the wicked dead will be raised and judged 
according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to

[23] according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to 
everlasting punishment in the lake which burneth with fi  re and brimstone, which is 
the second death (Matthew 25:46; Mark 9:43–48; Revelation 19:20; 20:11–15; 21:8).
16. THE NEW HEAVENS AND THE NEW EARTH
“We, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein 
dwelleth righteousness” (2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 21,22).
Scripture quotations are from the King James Version of the Holy Bible.

Romans 13:7 argues to offer the state worship.  While Christians generally obey and 
submit to earthly authorities, earthly authorities are not absolutes. All submission occurs 
under the umbrella of Christian allegiance to God. His Person and kingdom cannot be 
compared with or subjected to any earthly power. 
 
Witness as Our Core Mission 
For the New Testament writers, being witnesses of God’s reconciling work in Christ is a 
core responsibility of believers . Anything that interferes with this work opposes the 
Christian faith, no matter the motivation. Acting in the name of Christ while  undermining 
the gospel’s presentation and the Church’s mission risks disobedience to Christ (Matthew 
28:19–20). Let it not be said of us that people blaspheme the name of God because of 
us (Romans 2:24). 
 
Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present

[27] us (Romans 2:24). 
 
Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present  
simplistic answers that create us -vs-them scenarios . Desiring to make a positive 
difference in the world, well-meaning Christians often choose a side and universally adopt 
its stance on all the issues. In so doing, they can alienate others and damage their ability 
to witness to them. In a worst-case scenario, a chosen side might reveal itself as opposing 
Christian faith and virtue.  Christians must be careful in participating in any potentially 
harmful system that does not accurately represent Christ or His kingdom. 
 
Christians should ensure that their civic engagements are in harmony with their core 
task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere .

[28] task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere . 
Believers should take moral stands on issues that matter to God. However, they should 
exercise caution and discernment in how they do so, living as wise agents of Christ ’s 
kingdom. 
 
Salt and Light 
One of Jesus’ best-known teachings contains dual metaphors for Christian engagement 
with the world. “You are the salt of the earth,” He said, and “You are the light of the world” 
(Matthew 5:13–14). In the right measure, salt improves what it touches. Similarly, 
Christians improve their environment. Consider this  test for valid Christian engagement: 
Does our influence make our environment better or worse? 
 
Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in

[29] Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in 
heaven” (Matthew 5:16). Jesus expects His followers to radiate goodness that dispels the 
darkness of evil . The light of their  good works point s to the Father —the Source of 
goodness. It elicits genuine praise for God from those who observe these acts of light . 
Consider another key test  for Christian engagement: Are people drawn to God by our 
public actions and disposition, or are they turned off?

[30] 6 
Love of God and Others 
Jesus was asked, “Of all the commandments, which is the most important?” (Mark 12:28). 
He offered a simple and comprehensive answer: Love God with all your being and love 
others as if they were you. Love is not an add-on; the characteristic of love defines those 
living an authentically Christian faith (John 13:35). 
 
First Corinthians 13 provides the best description of love in the Christian community. This 
list of love ’s characteristics mirrors actions in  every sphere of life, including public li fe. 
Biblical love raises another question: How does our participation in politics and other civic 
duties reflect the criteria of love, regardless of our intentions?  
 
The Role of the Holy Spirit  
All Christians should seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance when engaging in civic and political 
matters. Every aspect of Christian life depends on the Holy Spirit. As in the life of Jesus,

[31] All Christians should seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance when engaging in civic and political 
matters. Every aspect of Christian life depends on the Holy Spirit. As in the life of Jesus, 
the Holy Spirit must play a central role in guiding, facilitating, and empowering believers’ 
private and public lives. Christians engaged in the work of citizenship on their own risk 
the peril faced by the Galatians. They attempted to complete God’s work in the energy of 
the flesh (Galatians 3:3). We must also resist the urge to misuse a spiritual gift to earn  
political approval . To do so would make one no better than the court prophets  of 
Jeremiah’s day , who only prophesied in favor of the king. Are we living  as citizens  
according to the Spirit’s fruit and gifts (Galatians 5:22–23; 1 Corinthians 12, etc.)? 
 
Conclusion 
 
Scripture does not single out one detailed model for Christian participation in civic and

[32] according to the Spirit’s fruit and gifts (Galatians 5:22–23; 1 Corinthians 12, etc.)? 
 
Conclusion 
 
Scripture does not single out one detailed model for Christian participation in civic and 
political spheres. As “the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and conduct,”
5 the Bible does 
offer powerful truths that should guide Christians ’ civic and political lives. T hroughout 
history, Christians have responded as best they could, in different political circumstances, 
as they sought to be faithful  to the Bible  in their unique contexts. From this important 
discussion comes the following summation for careful consideration. 
 
Believers must be mindful of their core identity as people of another kingdom. Allegiance 
to Christ as the only Lord and the defining role as His witnesses is crucial. As Christians 
act in love and as salt and light, under the guiding power of the Holy Spirit, they lead 
others to God, proclaim the gospel, and improve the world around them.

[33] act in love and as salt and light, under the guiding power of the Holy Spirit, they lead 
others to God, proclaim the gospel, and improve the world around them. 
 
Modern political movements are not centered around God’s destiny for humanity but 
rather focus on their ends. Further, they achieve those ends through power plays that 
rely on the successful domination of others rather than cooperation with the Holy Spirit. 
 
In practical terms, as followers of Christ and ministers of the gospel, we should:  
 
1. prioritize the gospel and its propagation far above personal and political 
allegiances;

📄 Context Sent to Model:
[1] young legal secretary suffering from severe physical and nervous exhaustion. Within 
days her friends marveled at how healthy she looked. Jones’s family had attended a 
Methodist church in Victoria, British Columbia, when Price arrived to hold an evan-
gelistic campaign. As a result, her family came into the Pentecostal movement. Her 
father, baptized in the Spirit during the meetings, felt called to the ministry. He later 
pastored and served as a district offi cial.
After her healing, Gwendoline (Gwen) Jones resigned her job and took up res-
idence in Seattle, where she enrolled at Northwest Bible Institute (now Northwest 
College). Her music training and editing of the college yearbook refl  ected the two 
great interests of her life: music and journalism. After graduation in 1939, she moved 
to Springfi  eld at the request of Noel Perkin, the missionary secretary, who had stayed 
in their home while preaching in her father’s church. “She came [to Springfi eld], and

[2] In 1965, Jones became the founding editor of 
Advance, a new minister’s magazine. Church lead-
ers wanted a person who understood the various 
departmental programs at headquarters as well as 
Council policies and doctrines. Few could fi  ll the 
bill better. In recognition of her accomplishments, 
the Evangelical Press Association elected her to its 
board of directors.
Over the years, Jones demonstrated the min-
istry that women could have in print media. She 
modeled effective leadership professionally and spiritually. “She demanded of herself 
the higher road of skills and effi  ciency; mediocrity was not in her vocabulary or behav-
ior,” remembers Projects Director Carol Ball. Women at the headquarters saw her as a 
mentor who enabled them to fi  nd their own way into productive ministry. “Observing 
Gwen, talking with her, seeking her counsel about routine questions,” added Ball, 
“helped me defi  ne the importance of my calling, the direction of my profession, and

[3] Sometimes single women missionaries teamed up for a 
work. Such was the case of Margaret J. Brown and Marcella 
Dorff, long-term missionaries to Indonesia. Margaret Brown 
arrived fi  rst, in 1945, along with her brother Elbert and his 
wife, Frances. After graduating from Northwest Bible Insti-
tute in Seattle, Wash ington (later Northwest College in Kirk-
land), Brown helped a classmate, Marie Dressler, in ministry 
in Idaho. A heart ailment, however, forced Brown’s return to 
Seattle. One night, struggling with her call to Indonesia, but 
aware that her heart condition disqualifi  ed her for appoint-
ment, she recommitted her life to Christ. “That night the Lord 
defi nitely healed me,” she wrote. “I  returned to the doctor 
who was astounded by my apparent good health!”
From the beginning of her ministry in Djakarta, Brown became involved in 
Bible school teaching. “A regular day’s work begins early,” she remembered, “usu-

[4] evangelist, John J. Ashcroft, went and sat beside her and prayed with her. Her conver-
sion and Spirit baptism at that meeting changed her life. She began to witness to her 
friends and, at age sixteen, she dedicated her life to full-time ministry.
Ashcroft and his wife began to mentor Hammond and invited her to accompany 
them to Martinsburg, West Virginia, where he was scheduled to preach. By Pente-
costal standards, the services seemed dry and without demonstration of the power 
of God. Finally, before a Saturday evening service, he invited her to preach. While 
the congregation sang, Hammond desperately prayed to receive a message from the 
Lord. He “dropped into her heart” the verse, “O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched 
you, that ye should not obey the truth [?]” (Galatians 3:1, KJV). 
Stepping to the pulpit, she quoted the verse, paused momentarily, and then 
quoted it again. Without being able to launch into a sermon, she looked at the con-

ull-time ministry in the Assemblies of God has always appeared to be the 
domain of pastors, evangelists, and missionaries. On closer examination, the 
ministries of editors, writers, and educators have also been indispensable to the 
mission of the Church. Furthermore, whether working at the denominational head-
quarters in Springfi eld, Missouri, or teaching in colleges and seminaries, such people 
have played crucial parts in building the reputation for doctrinal stability that the 
General Council has enjoyed. 
Over the years, Gospel Publishing House (GPH) and the headquarters operation 
have been lightning rods for the criticism of those who mistrust the work of church 
bureaucracies. Editors, writers, managers, printers, artists, secretaries, mail clerks, 
and food servers don’t attain the kind of glamour that Pentecostals usually associate 
with power-packed ministry. Yet, such persons turn the wheels of church machinery

spent years writing and editing church publications to inspire and disciple the people 
in the pew and keep revival fi res burning.
The dedication required for their ministries 
compares favorably with that required of other 
endeavors in the General Council. Among those 
rarely in the limelight, Dorothy Morris and artist 
Norman Pearsall labored long in the preparation 
of Sunday School literature. (In a chapel service 
at Central Bible College, Pearsall once quipped, 
“God called me to preach until He heard me!” In 
any event, he became a gifted artist with a deep 
devotion to ministry.) Dorothy Kirschke, a sec-
retary in the music department, played a major 
part in the preparation of Hymns of Glorious Praise 
(1969), the fi  rst hymnal (rather than gospel song-
book like Melodies of Praise) produced by GPH.

Joyce Wells Booze, Janet Walker, and Beverly 
Graham placed the urgency of missions before

formerly the monthly missionary magazine of 
the Assemblies of God. Juleen Turnage ably represented the Assemblies of God to 
its public constituencies through her service as director of public relations, gaining 
widespread respect for her work during the televangelist scandals of the 1980s.
The roll call gets much longer for church publications when one adds faculty 
members in Assemblies of God schools, many of whom have enlarged the scope of 
their ministries by writing as well as teaching at overseas training schools during the 
summers.

We Called Him T.J.
T
he words of our little old professor’s prayer were 
always the same as, without warning, he bowed his 
snowy white head to commence class, “Open our eyes 
that we may behold wondrous things out of Thy Word and 
bless these precious students for Jesus’ sake. Amen.” As 
students at North Central Bible College there was no doubt 
in our minds that the Reverend T.J. Jones was deeply con-
cerned about our hearts, our minds, and our ministry to a 
lost and dying world. 
We students who were reared in Sunday school con-
sidered the ﬁ rst ﬁ ve books of the Holy Bible, known as 
the Pentateuch, to be extremely boring and nonessential. 
Most of us were completely unfamiliar with its content, except for a few action-packed 
stories. Our feelings about the Old Testament, and the Pentateuch in particular, soon 
began to change as this advanced student of the Word made these books come alive.

[12] stories. Our feelings about the Old Testament, and the Pentateuch in particular, soon 
began to change as this advanced student of the Word made these books come alive. 
Nothing was omitted as T.J. read aloud every single verse, explaining each term 
and deﬁ  ning various individual words. A big, black Bible was always at his side, but he 
much preferred reading from small, separate paperback books of the Bible. They were 
much easier for him to hold close to his face as he sat on a high stool with both arms 
resting on the lectern. 
Fifty years of strenuous preaching had greatly taxed the voice of our lovable 
instructor. It wasn’t exactly melodious as he spoke into the small microphone clipped 
to his lapel. But, oh, the truths that came forth from that scholar of the Word! We con-
sidered him a scholar because he could tell us what was in every chapter of the Bible 
and could quote most of it, too. But T.J. thought of himself as “just a student” of God’s 
precious Word.

[13] sidered him a scholar because he could tell us what was in every chapter of the Bible 
and could quote most of it, too. But T.J. thought of himself as “just a student” of God’s 
precious Word. 
Our predecessors frequently tried to tell us that we should have heard T.J. Jones 20 
years ago or more when he was really ﬁ  ery and full of life. Our retort was simply, “T.J. 
knows more now.” We reasoned that a man would have to be wiser after studying the 
Bible every day for that many additional years. Besides, his brilliant mind was still as 
sharp as a tack. 
The quaint old gentleman, who knew what he was talking about, often interspersed 
nuggets of personal wisdom in his teaching of the Scriptures. Since “One hamburger 
was cheaper than two,” he didn’t marry until after he had pioneered a few churches. 
Continually T.J. encouraged the young men to get their books ﬁ  rst, then their Buick, and 
last of all their bride. Some advice was hard to follow.

T.J. wasn’t able to move about as he wanted to when he became excited, but that 
didn’t keep him from dramatizing Moses’ reply to Pharaoh, “Not a hoof shall be left 
behind!” Not even Leviticus was dry after T. J. Jones got done with it. His words held 
true, “The drier the book, the more it burns.” 
The complex study of Daniel and Revelation was diﬃ   cult for most of us, and even 
after weeks in the class many things weren’t clear in our minds. Often T.J. asked a diﬃ  cult 
question and no one was able to answer. His expression would change to one of despair

as he asked, “Have I been with you so long and still you do not know?” After a lengthy 
pause he would begin to go through the material until our minds were enlightened. 
The Jones’ course in typology was considerably less diﬃ   cult with the aid of a com-
plete full-scale model of the tabernacle in front of the class. Sometimes he would get 
so thrilled while teaching that he’d start to sing. An original song of his was about going 
through the courtyard and Holy Place and into the Holy of Holies. His creaky singing 
was thoroughly enjoyed by all of us, but he would stop abruptly and blurt out, “You 
don’t want to hear me sing.” Not too many days passed, though, until he’d get the urge 
to sing for us again.

[16] to sing for us again. 
T. J. Jones lived to preach and teach God’s Holy Word. He always came to class with 
an armful of books, including a notebook stuffed full with notes sticking out each side 
of it. His organization was such that only he could ﬁ  gure it out. When reading from one 
page fastened in the notebook, he would suddenly pull out a slip of paper from another 
part. Scribbled on it would be a continuation of what he was reading or an augmen-
tation to it. When he ﬁ nished with the piece he would jam it back in somewhere—or 
anywhere—who knows? 
A “scrap” he pulled out one day was an old tattered Christmas church bulletin on 
which he had jotted some valuable notes. How he could ﬁ  gure out such a seemingly 
disorganized system was amazing to us. 
Never was Brother Jones to be interrupted while teaching. When such an event hap-

[17] Never was Brother Jones to be interrupted while teaching. When such an event hap-
pened, it was evident he was not pleased. Whenever a fellow walked into class late, T.J. 
would stop immediately and begin to question, “Young man, was your tea too hot or 
are you trying to impress the girls?” If T. J. then gave his unmistakable giggle with three 
ﬁ ngers raised in front of his mouth, we knew everything was all right. But that wasn’t 
always the case. Whenever he was late, though, he blamed it on the slow elevator. 
Heartfelt concern for students marked the ministry of T. J. Jones at North Central 
Bible College. Besides increasing our head knowledge of God’s Word, he daily encour-
aged us to hide it in our hearts that we might not sin against God. It was also this great 
man’s joy to bear students’ burdens whenever he was asked to pray in chapel. After

[18] man’s joy to bear students’ burdens whenever he was asked to pray in chapel. After 
reading the requests, he would place the cards in his hands and raise them high as he 
poured out his soul to the Lord. Prayers were answered. 
Occasionally he spoke about getting old and assured us that the song “Beautiful 
Isle of Somewhere” was deﬁ  nitely not going to be heard at his funeral. In a determined 
voice he explained that he was not going to a beautiful isle somewhere, but he was 
going to heaven to see his Jesus! 
On July 17, 1970, Jesus Christ became T.J.’s joy of heaven and no longer his hope 
of earth. Sure enough, not a strain of “Beautiful Isle of Somewhere” was heard at that 
glorious funeral. Instead the air was ﬁ  lled with the melodies of his favorite songs: “All 
the Way My Saviour Leads Me,” “God Will Take Care of You,” “Face to Face,” and “Jesus 
Led Me All the Way.” 
We surely miss Rev. Thomas James Jones, but we know heaven is happier with the 
presence of such a saint.

[20] Before his departure, Perkin had recommended that he read two books by Roland 
Allen, Missionary Methods: St. Paul’s or Ours? (1912) and The Spontaneous Expansion of the 
Church and the Causes Which Hinder It (1927). Hodges’s assignment to work with Ralph D. 
Williams, an understudy of Alice E. Luce, afforded him the opportunity to learn fi rst-
hand within a context already being fashioned by the teachings of Allen. Eventually, 
El Salvador became a showcase of church planting. 
After ten months there, Melvin and Lois and their family moved to Matagalpa, 
Nicaragua. They traveled extensively to survey the churches, often living in primitive 
conditions. Convinced that training would best equip national ministers to reach 
their own people, he founded a Bible institute in Matagalpa. Those who enrolled 
were required to combine their studies with evangelism and church planting.

After Hodges’s arrival in Central America, his penchant for writing became evi-
dent: A steady stream of letters and reports fl  owed from his pen to church publica-
tions. Using a simple style, he wrote in English and Spanish to the common person.
At the close of their second term in 1944, the Hodgeses returned to the United 
States physically exhausted. He accepted an invitation to the headquarters in Spring-
fi eld, Missouri, and worked for fi  ve years as editor of mission publications. In 1948, he 
became the founding editor of Missionary Forum, an in-house publication for missionary 
personnel. Using this as his pulpit, Hodges heralded the values of building self-sup-
porting churches. In this, he joined with the missionary secretary, Noel Perkin, who

the many orphanages and charitable institutions they supported. Perkin reasoned that 
“the material and physical need of the people in many lands is relatively unlimited, so 
that all available missionary funds could readily be absorbed in such work.” Still, he 
credited the home constituency with a continuing interest in the needy, observing that 
fi nancial appeals from these efforts consistently gained responses when others failed. 
For Hodges and Perkin, both of whom deeply cared about suffering people, charitable 
ministries represented by-products of evangelism, not primary means to that end.

[23] Yet it is fair to say that mission leaders sometimes misjudged the value of chari-
table institutions in countries like Egypt and India for training church leaders. In Ted 
and Estelle Vassar’s orphanage in South India, young men who desired to enter the 
ministry were encouraged to “learn a trade along with their Bible training. They were 
admonished not to rely solely on the Western Church for their support. From child-
hood, the orphans had chores for which they received an allowance and they were 
taught to tithe.” Notable Indian church leaders emerged from this institution with an 
abiding appreciation for their tutelage.
In 1951, the Foreign Missions Department invited Hodges to address a special 
gathering of missionaries. His lectures formed the basis for what would become his 
best-known book, The Indigenous Church, published two years later. Noting one of the

ability—not unlike the rugged fi  shermen who fi  rst followed the Lord.” 
After a third term in Central America, Hodges again returned to Springfi  eld, 
this time to become fi  eld secretary for Latin America and the West Indies. He began 
his job by overseeing the activities of nearly two hundred missionaries, planning 
strategy, and developing specialized ministries in radio, literature, and ministerial 
training. Over the years he and other leaders retrained the entire missionary force in 
understanding the nature of indigenous church principles and how to apply them. 
Not surprisingly, this changed the relationship of missionaries with national church 
leaders from one of paternal control to partnership.

[26] At the same time, charitable institutions continued and new ones developed; 
gradually the Assemblies of God developed a holistic theology of mission. In this 
respect, the practice of its mission program has been a pilgrimage: a long-standing 
resolve to be true to the Great Commission, along with a search to understand its 
implications for caring for the impoverished and despised.
Hodges contributed to the education of thousands of missionaries (both Pente-
costal and non-Pentecostal), who in turn prepared many more thousands of pastors, 
evangelists, and church workers. In addition, he became the leading Pentecostal mis-
siologist and the fi  rst to be published outside of denominational publications; his 
public became worldwide.
At sixty-four years of age and after twenty years’ service as fi  eld secretary, he

. . . . The ﬁ  rst Bible school in Indonesia opened in 1947, shortly after World War II 
ended. Missionaries Raymond and Beryl E. Busby started a night school in [Djakarta], 
the capital of Indonesia. Most of the men who pastor the 80 to 85 Assemblies of God 
churches on the island of Java were trained at this original night school and a school 
established later in Malang.

Marcella Dorff grew up in Fargo, North Dakota, and 
enrolled at North Central Bible College in Minneapolis, Min-
nesota. From the time of her conversion, she heard the call to 
missions. While still in Fargo, she had a vision while in prayer 
and saw “brown skinned people coming down a mountain to 
hear the Word and they were so happy.” At North Central her 
interest grew, but she hesitated to tell anyone lest her dream 
not come true. She asked the Lord to give her a sign by hav-
ing someone else confi  rm the call to her.
During her junior year, the Lord impressed on her the 
spiritual needs of Indonesia. Reminding Him of her request, 
she suddenly remembered the fate of Zechariah, father of John the Baptist, who also 
demanded a sign (Luke 1:18–20). “Icy chills ran down my back,” she remembered, “and

[30] she suddenly remembered the fate of Zechariah, father of John the Baptist, who also

I said, ‘Lord, I can’t be stricken dumb, I am in school and I must earn my living.’ In 
a fl  ash it was made plain what God was trying to show me and I  said ‘Yes, [that] 
I believed it was God’s will and I would tell others about my call.’”
Finishing her studies, Dorff went to Owatonna, Min nesota, and spent fi ve years 
pioneering an Assemblies of God church. Lessons of faith learned there prepared her 
for the mission fi  eld. On one occasion she asked a real estate agent to help her fi nd 
a new place of worship with only ten dollars “between [me] and the church.” A house 
was purchased, and nine months later so were several lots for the construction of a 
church building—“God helped us to meet every payment.”

Dorff departed for Indonesia in December 1952. Visiting Gambangwaluh in a 
remote area sometime later, she saw people walking down mountain paths to attend 
the church there. Observing this, she said, “I was reminded of what I had seen when 
I was fi rst saved.”
In 1955, she opened a Bible institute in Malang, East Java. Several months  later, 
Margaret Brown joined her and thus began a successful partnership. In addition to 
the normal activities required in such schools, they supervised student church plant-
ing in the area. Spending almost forty years each in Bible school teaching and admin-
istration, they trained hundreds of pastors and church leaders and left their mark 
on the Indonesian Assemblies of God. When it was decided that a male national 
minister would direct the school, Brown and Dorff moved to a different region and

can be accomplished.” Three years later, however, as an American perceived to be a 
threat to a rebel cause, he was clubbed to death, his body taken fi  fty miles into the 
jungle, and thrown into the crocodile-infested Bomokandi River.
After the Belgian Congo was granted independence, civil war had broken out. 
Well aware of the risk involved, Jay and Angeline Tucker left the capital, Leopoldville 
(now Kinshasha), where it was safer, and returned with their children to the city of 
Paulis (now Isiro). Both had been hesitant about returning. But one night while still 
in the capital, Angeline had gone into the room where their children were sleeping.

[34] “Lord, what shall we do?” she prayed, “What about taking them into this area?” At 
that moment, she heard His answer: “I promise to deliver these children, not from, 
but out of the den of lions.” Angeline and Jay did not yet know that the rebels called 
themselves “simbas”—Swahili for “lions.” 
The rebel Simbas eventually took control of Paulis, placing the Tuckers and other 
Westerners under house arrest. Then the rebels took Jay into custody and held him, 
with other hostages, in a Catholic mission. Fearing an attack by American and Bel-
gian paratroopers, the insurgents hardened their attitudes toward the prisoners. 
Several days passed. Angeline had received no word about her husband. Finally she 
telephoned the mission to inquire about his welfare. In guarded words, “the Mother 
Superior . . . said, ‘Well, things are going along.’ I said, ‘How is my husband?’ She 
answered in French, ‘He is in heaven.’”

America and settled in Springfi  eld, Missouri. Angeline later served in the national 
Women’s Missionary Council (later, the Women’s Ministries Department).

[36] PEOPLE OF THE SPIRIT
The doctors said overwork caused his physical and mental breakdown in 1932, 
which required him to leave India. To this could be added the toll on his health taken 
by malaria. Without doubting the truthfulness of these explanations, he also knew 
“that God allowed me to pass through a nervous breakdown, and immediately after 
delivering me, illuminated my mind to picture and understand something of our 
Lord’s experiences in the garden, and their bearing on the nature of redemption’s 
victory.”
Like John of the Cross, a sixteenth-century mystic, Cummings began to expe-
rience the descent into the “dark night of the soul.” For the fi  rst three months, he 
seemed to lose all willpower and “became the prey of the most terribly vile and 
blasphemous evil powers. . . . Horrible and obscene suggestions and imaginations

[37] blasphemous evil powers. . . . Horrible and obscene suggestions and imaginations 
poured in an unceasing fl  ood through my consciousness.” Sleep became impossi-
ble without medication. Finally, “I felt as though I had been dragged through the 
sewers of hell.” All of the joys he had experienced in the Holy Spirit had now left 
him.
His worst fears were soon realized: The devil seemed to ask him, “Do you think, 
after the Lord has fi lled you once, and now that I have trapped you and fl ooded your 
soul with all this evil, that the Lord could ever cleanse you and take you back again?” 
Reluctantly, he agreed, believing that he had committed the unpardonable sin; all 
hope had vanished. In the words of John of the Cross, “The soul feels itself to be so 
impure and miserable that it believes God to be against it, and thinks that it has set 
itself up against God . . . that God has cast it away.”

[38] itself up against God . . . that God has cast it away.”
After two years of suffering, which included time spent in New York mental hos-
pitals, Cummings began to listen and internalize the Scripture promise pressed on 
him by several friends: “I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee” (Hebrews 13:5). For 
the fi  rst time in two years, on October 4, 1934, he fell to his knees and began to pray: 
“‘Lord,’ I said, ‘I am ashamed even to get into an attitude of prayer. I have been so 
resentful. My mind and heart and being have been so fi  lled with things which must be 
more repulsive to Thee than they are to me. I know now that there is no hope for me. 
I don’t believe you could ever take me back. But, Lord, I wonder if I could be wrong? 
You see in what terrible darkness and hopelessness every moment of my experience 
is spent. Lord, if there is anything you can do for me, won’t you do it? I would pray

[39] You see in what terrible darkness and hopelessness every moment of my experience 
is spent. Lord, if there is anything you can do for me, won’t you do it? I would pray 
if I could, but I can’t pray. There are no words to describe what I feel. Anyway, I don’t 
even feel. My heart is like a lump of stone.’”
He remembered that deep in his consciousness “a chorus began to sing.” It was 
line 2 of the song “In Jesus” that suddenly became illuminated with meaning. Written 
by James Procter, a former atheist who became a Christian, it reads:
My soul is night, my heart is steel;
I cannot see, I cannot feel;
For light, for life, I must appeal
In simple faith to Jesus.

[40] Then, “as the last word sang itself out in the silence of my heart, I knew HE stood 
with me. He gathered me in His arms and brought me into a place of nearness that 
I had never known before. His precious blood cleansed away all the stain and sin, all 
the feeling of evil, all the effect of that terrible experience. . . . The fetters snapped and 
I was free. O the unspeakable joy of that deliverance!”
Sometime later, while staying in New York City, Cummings rose early one morn-
ing. “While I was praying,” he recalled, “it seemed as though God took me by the hand 
into the garden of His agony, and showed me His Son there. My mind was astonished 
at what I saw. The Son of God appeared to be crushed. It seemed that He could not 
stand the horror of the thing that confronted Him.” Asking God what could have been 
in the cup that nearly overwhelmed Jesus, the Lord replied, “Do you not remember

[41] in the cup that nearly overwhelmed Jesus, the Lord replied, “Do you not remember 
the terror through which you passed during the fi  rst months of your nervous break-
down? Do you not remember calling out, ‘O God, it is impossible for me to endure 
another moment of this awful horror’? I was allowing you to taste a little, a very little, 
of the cup that My Son drank to its dregs, the cup of the world’s iniquity and sin.” 
In the early 1940s the Cummingses became affi  liated with the Assemblies of God 
and were invited to join the CBI faculty, Bob as director of missions and Mid as an 
instructor in English and Hindi. 
For the rest of his life and ministry, Cummings shared his insights into Christ’s 
sufferings in Gethsemane. Along with his uncommon discernment in the operation 
of the gifts of the Spirit in worship, his message of Christ as the sin-bearer for the 
redemption of lost humanity left a deep imprint on many Pentecostals, especially his 
students.

the use of musical instruments

continuing in the ministry; and the popular “I’m Going Higher,” after seeing an air-

youth services. The song leader would sometimes have the audience sing the chorus 
of the song seated, then standing, and fi  nally mounted on their chairs (on outings, 
they might stand on picnic tables).
Buffum’s compositions touched the chords of joy and sorrow in the Christian life 
and often reminded believers of their heavenly hope. In many ways, he shaped early 
twentieth-century evangelical and Pentecostal worship patterns. He had no formal 
training in music; nevertheless, his self-instruction and unusual ability enabled him 
to learn virtually any keyboard or stringed instrument.

[48] With enormous powers of concentration, Buffum could write songs (music and 
lyrics) during church services, in hotel lobbies, on trains, and in train stations, even 
while his four children climbed all over him. According to his daughter Lois, only 
one thing could throw off his concentration: singing another song. If no piano was 
available, Buffum would improvise on a table or another piece of furniture and tap 
out the song. He would even invite congregations to get into the act. First, he would 
have them suggest song titles. Writing the suggestions on a chalkboard, he would 
then have them vote on their top choice. Finally, he would compose a matching song 
on the spot.
In Huntington Beach, California, an eleven-year-old girl suggested the title 
“When I Take My Vacation in Heaven.” Although the congregation didn’t choose this 
one, Buffum was intrigued by it. By the next morning, he had composed the song.

[49] “When I Take My Vacation in Heaven.” Although the congregation didn’t choose this

Although he usually sold the rights to a song for fi  ve dollars—just enough for food 
and basic expenses—he sold this one for one hundred dollars; it became immensely 
popular, moving into the secular market.
The life and ministry of Herbert Buffum epitomizes the church’s troubadour, 
those who itinerated with the gospel in song. Their melodies and choruses not only 
enriched worship, they also infl  uenced day-to-day life, leaving a lyric in the heart that 
enabled the believer to maintain a walk of faith. Their legacy of music blessed gener-
ations of people in all walks of life in congregations around the world.

[1] young legal secretary suffering from severe physical and nervous exhaustion. Within 
days her friends marveled at how healthy she looked. Jones’s family had attended a 
Methodist church in Victoria, British Columbia, when Price arrived to hold an evan-
gelistic campaign. As a result, her family came into the Pentecostal movement. Her 
father, baptized in the Spirit during the meetings, felt called to the ministry. He later 
pastored and served as a district offi cial.
After her healing, Gwendoline (Gwen) Jones resigned her job and took up res-
idence in Seattle, where she enrolled at Northwest Bible Institute (now Northwest 
College). Her music training and editing of the college yearbook refl  ected the two 
great interests of her life: music and journalism. After graduation in 1939, she moved 
to Springfi  eld at the request of Noel Perkin, the missionary secretary, who had stayed 
in their home while preaching in her father’s church. “She came [to Springfi eld], and

departmental programs at headquarters as well as 
Council policies and doctrines. Few could fi  ll the 
bill better. In recognition of her accomplishments, 
the Evangelical Press Association elected her to its 
board of directors.
Over the years, Jones demonstrated the min-
istry that women could have in print media. She 
modeled effective leadership professionally and spiritually. “She demanded of herself 
the higher road of skills and effi  ciency; mediocrity was not in her vocabulary or behav-
ior,” remembers Projects Director Carol Ball. Women at the headquarters saw her as a 
mentor who enabled them to fi  nd their own way into productive ministry. “Observing 
Gwen, talking with her, seeking her counsel about routine questions,” added Ball, 
“helped me defi  ne the importance of my calling, the direction of my profession, and

work. Such was the case of Margaret J. Brown and Marcella

wife, Frances. After graduating from Northwest Bible Insti-
tute in Seattle, Wash ington (later Northwest College in Kirk-
land), Brown helped a classmate, Marie Dressler, in ministry 
in Idaho. A heart ailment, however, forced Brown’s return to 
Seattle. One night, struggling with her call to Indonesia, but 
aware that her heart condition disqualifi  ed her for appoint-
ment, she recommitted her life to Christ. “That night the Lord 
defi nitely healed me,” she wrote. “I  returned to the doctor 
who was astounded by my apparent good health!”
From the beginning of her ministry in Djakarta, Brown became involved in 
Bible school teaching. “A regular day’s work begins early,” she remembered, “usu-

friends and, at age sixteen, she dedicated her life to full-time ministry.
Ashcroft and his wife began to mentor Hammond and invited her to accompany 
them to Martinsburg, West Virginia, where he was scheduled to preach. By Pente-
costal standards, the services seemed dry and without demonstration of the power 
of God. Finally, before a Saturday evening service, he invited her to preach. While 
the congregation sang, Hammond desperately prayed to receive a message from the 
Lord. He “dropped into her heart” the verse, “O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched 
you, that ye should not obey the truth [?]” (Galatians 3:1, KJV). 
Stepping to the pulpit, she quoted the verse, paused momentarily, and then 
quoted it again. Without being able to launch into a sermon, she looked at the con-

ull-time ministry in the Assemblies of God has always appeared to be the 
domain of pastors, evangelists, and missionaries. On closer examination, the 
ministries of editors, writers, and educators have also been indispensable to the 
mission of the Church. Furthermore, whether working at the denominational head-
quarters in Springfi eld, Missouri, or teaching in colleges and seminaries, such people 
have played crucial parts in building the reputation for doctrinal stability that the 
General Council has enjoyed. 
Over the years, Gospel Publishing House (GPH) and the headquarters operation 
have been lightning rods for the criticism of those who mistrust the work of church 
bureaucracies. Editors, writers, managers, printers, artists, secretaries, mail clerks, 
and food servers don’t attain the kind of glamour that Pentecostals usually associate 
with power-packed ministry. Yet, such persons turn the wheels of church machinery

spent years writing and editing church publications to inspire and disciple the people 
in the pew and keep revival fi res burning.
The dedication required for their ministries 
compares favorably with that required of other 
endeavors in the General Council. Among those 
rarely in the limelight, Dorothy Morris and artist 
Norman Pearsall labored long in the preparation 
of Sunday School literature. (In a chapel service 
at Central Bible College, Pearsall once quipped, 
“God called me to preach until He heard me!” In 
any event, he became a gifted artist with a deep 
devotion to ministry.) Dorothy Kirschke, a sec-
retary in the music department, played a major 
part in the preparation of Hymns of Glorious Praise 
(1969), the fi  rst hymnal (rather than gospel song-
book like Melodies of Praise) produced by GPH.

Joyce Wells Booze, Janet Walker, and Beverly 
Graham placed the urgency of missions before 
the denomination by editing Mountain Movers, 
formerly the monthly missionary magazine of 
the Assemblies of God. Juleen Turnage ably represented the Assemblies of God to 
its public constituencies through her service as director of public relations, gaining 
widespread respect for her work during the televangelist scandals of the 1980s.
The roll call gets much longer for church publications when one adds faculty 
members in Assemblies of God schools, many of whom have enlarged the scope of 
their ministries by writing as well as teaching at overseas training schools during the 
summers.

faith, Missionettes training stretches from 
age three to the high school years: Rain-

We Called Him T.J.
T
he words of our little old professor’s prayer were 
always the same as, without warning, he bowed his 
snowy white head to commence class, “Open our eyes 
that we may behold wondrous things out of Thy Word and 
bless these precious students for Jesus’ sake. Amen.” As 
students at North Central Bible College there was no doubt 
in our minds that the Reverend T.J. Jones was deeply con-
cerned about our hearts, our minds, and our ministry to a 
lost and dying world. 
We students who were reared in Sunday school con-
sidered the ﬁ rst ﬁ ve books of the Holy Bible, known as 
the Pentateuch, to be extremely boring and nonessential. 
Most of us were completely unfamiliar with its content, except for a few action-packed 
stories. Our feelings about the Old Testament, and the Pentateuch in particular, soon 
began to change as this advanced student of the Word made these books come alive.

[12] stories. Our feelings about the Old Testament, and the Pentateuch in particular, soon 
began to change as this advanced student of the Word made these books come alive. 
Nothing was omitted as T.J. read aloud every single verse, explaining each term 
and deﬁ  ning various individual words. A big, black Bible was always at his side, but he 
much preferred reading from small, separate paperback books of the Bible. They were 
much easier for him to hold close to his face as he sat on a high stool with both arms 
resting on the lectern. 
Fifty years of strenuous preaching had greatly taxed the voice of our lovable 
instructor. It wasn’t exactly melodious as he spoke into the small microphone clipped 
to his lapel. But, oh, the truths that came forth from that scholar of the Word! We con-
sidered him a scholar because he could tell us what was in every chapter of the Bible 
and could quote most of it, too. But T.J. thought of himself as “just a student” of God’s 
precious Word.

and could quote most of it, too. But T.J. thought of himself as “just a student” of God’s 
precious Word. 
Our predecessors frequently tried to tell us that we should have heard T.J. Jones 20 
years ago or more when he was really ﬁ  ery and full of life. Our retort was simply, “T.J. 
knows more now.” We reasoned that a man would have to be wiser after studying the 
Bible every day for that many additional years. Besides, his brilliant mind was still as 
sharp as a tack. 
The quaint old gentleman, who knew what he was talking about, often interspersed 
nuggets of personal wisdom in his teaching of the Scriptures. Since “One hamburger 
was cheaper than two,” he didn’t marry until after he had pioneered a few churches. 
Continually T.J. encouraged the young men to get their books ﬁ  rst, then their Buick, and 
last of all their bride. Some advice was hard to follow.

T.J. wasn’t able to move about as he wanted to when he became excited, but that 
didn’t keep him from dramatizing Moses’ reply to Pharaoh, “Not a hoof shall be left 
behind!” Not even Leviticus was dry after T. J. Jones got done with it. His words held 
true, “The drier the book, the more it burns.” 
The complex study of Daniel and Revelation was diﬃ   cult for most of us, and even 
after weeks in the class many things weren’t clear in our minds. Often T.J. asked a diﬃ  cult 
question and no one was able to answer. His expression would change to one of despair

as he asked, “Have I been with you so long and still you do not know?” After a lengthy 
pause he would begin to go through the material until our minds were enlightened. 
The Jones’ course in typology was considerably less diﬃ   cult with the aid of a com-
plete full-scale model of the tabernacle in front of the class. Sometimes he would get 
so thrilled while teaching that he’d start to sing. An original song of his was about going 
through the courtyard and Holy Place and into the Holy of Holies. His creaky singing 
was thoroughly enjoyed by all of us, but he would stop abruptly and blurt out, “You 
don’t want to hear me sing.” Not too many days passed, though, until he’d get the urge 
to sing for us again.

T. J. Jones lived to preach and teach God’s Holy Word. He always came to class with 
an armful of books, including a notebook stuffed full with notes sticking out each side 
of it. His organization was such that only he could ﬁ  gure it out. When reading from one 
page fastened in the notebook, he would suddenly pull out a slip of paper from another 
part. Scribbled on it would be a continuation of what he was reading or an augmen-
tation to it. When he ﬁ nished with the piece he would jam it back in somewhere—or 
anywhere—who knows? 
A “scrap” he pulled out one day was an old tattered Christmas church bulletin on 
which he had jotted some valuable notes. How he could ﬁ  gure out such a seemingly 
disorganized system was amazing to us. 
Never was Brother Jones to be interrupted while teaching. When such an event hap-

[17] Never was Brother Jones to be interrupted while teaching. When such an event hap-
pened, it was evident he was not pleased. Whenever a fellow walked into class late, T.J. 
would stop immediately and begin to question, “Young man, was your tea too hot or 
are you trying to impress the girls?” If T. J. then gave his unmistakable giggle with three 
ﬁ ngers raised in front of his mouth, we knew everything was all right. But that wasn’t 
always the case. Whenever he was late, though, he blamed it on the slow elevator. 
Heartfelt concern for students marked the ministry of T. J. Jones at North Central 
Bible College. Besides increasing our head knowledge of God’s Word, he daily encour-
aged us to hide it in our hearts that we might not sin against God. It was also this great 
man’s joy to bear students’ burdens whenever he was asked to pray in chapel. After

[18] man’s joy to bear students’ burdens whenever he was asked to pray in chapel. After 
reading the requests, he would place the cards in his hands and raise them high as he 
poured out his soul to the Lord. Prayers were answered. 
Occasionally he spoke about getting old and assured us that the song “Beautiful 
Isle of Somewhere” was deﬁ  nitely not going to be heard at his funeral. In a determined 
voice he explained that he was not going to a beautiful isle somewhere, but he was 
going to heaven to see his Jesus! 
On July 17, 1970, Jesus Christ became T.J.’s joy of heaven and no longer his hope 
of earth. Sure enough, not a strain of “Beautiful Isle of Somewhere” was heard at that 
glorious funeral. Instead the air was ﬁ  lled with the melodies of his favorite songs: “All 
the Way My Saviour Leads Me,” “God Will Take Care of You,” “Face to Face,” and “Jesus 
Led Me All the Way.” 
We surely miss Rev. Thomas James Jones, but we know heaven is happier with the 
presence of such a saint.

[20] Before his departure, Perkin had recommended that he read two books by Roland 
Allen, Missionary Methods: St. Paul’s or Ours? (1912) and The Spontaneous Expansion of the 
Church and the Causes Which Hinder It (1927). Hodges’s assignment to work with Ralph D. 
Williams, an understudy of Alice E. Luce, afforded him the opportunity to learn fi rst-
hand within a context already being fashioned by the teachings of Allen. Eventually, 
El Salvador became a showcase of church planting. 
After ten months there, Melvin and Lois and their family moved to Matagalpa, 
Nicaragua. They traveled extensively to survey the churches, often living in primitive 
conditions. Convinced that training would best equip national ministers to reach 
their own people, he founded a Bible institute in Matagalpa. Those who enrolled 
were required to combine their studies with evangelism and church planting.

[21] were required to combine their studies with evangelism and church planting.
After Hodges’s arrival in Central America, his penchant for writing became evi-
dent: A steady stream of letters and reports fl  owed from his pen to church publica-
tions. Using a simple style, he wrote in English and Spanish to the common person.
At the close of their second term in 1944, the Hodgeses returned to the United 
States physically exhausted. He accepted an invitation to the headquarters in Spring-
fi eld, Missouri, and worked for fi  ve years as editor of mission publications. In 1948, he 
became the founding editor of Missionary Forum, an in-house publication for missionary 
personnel. Using this as his pulpit, Hodges heralded the values of building self-sup-
porting churches. In this, he joined with the missionary secretary, Noel Perkin, who 
cautioned the missionaries about the growing expenses of maintaining and enlarging

[22] porting churches. In this, he joined with the missionary secretary, Noel Perkin, who 
cautioned the missionaries about the growing expenses of maintaining and enlarging 
the many orphanages and charitable institutions they supported. Perkin reasoned that 
“the material and physical need of the people in many lands is relatively unlimited, so 
that all available missionary funds could readily be absorbed in such work.” Still, he 
credited the home constituency with a continuing interest in the needy, observing that 
fi nancial appeals from these efforts consistently gained responses when others failed. 
For Hodges and Perkin, both of whom deeply cared about suffering people, charitable 
ministries represented by-products of evangelism, not primary means to that end.
Yet it is fair to say that mission leaders sometimes misjudged the value of chari-
table institutions in countries like Egypt and India for training church leaders. In Ted

[23] Yet it is fair to say that mission leaders sometimes misjudged the value of chari-
table institutions in countries like Egypt and India for training church leaders. In Ted 
and Estelle Vassar’s orphanage in South India, young men who desired to enter the 
ministry were encouraged to “learn a trade along with their Bible training. They were 
admonished not to rely solely on the Western Church for their support. From child-
hood, the orphans had chores for which they received an allowance and they were 
taught to tithe.” Notable Indian church leaders emerged from this institution with an 
abiding appreciation for their tutelage.
In 1951, the Foreign Missions Department invited Hodges to address a special 
gathering of missionaries. His lectures formed the basis for what would become his 
best-known book, The Indigenous Church, published two years later. Noting one of the 
key ingredients for Pentecostal church growth, he declared, “The faith which Pente-

and unlearned,’ has raised up a host of lay preachers and leaders of unusual spiritual 
ability—not unlike the rugged fi  shermen who fi  rst followed the Lord.” 
After a third term in Central America, Hodges again returned to Springfi  eld, 
this time to become fi  eld secretary for Latin America and the West Indies. He began 
his job by overseeing the activities of nearly two hundred missionaries, planning 
strategy, and developing specialized ministries in radio, literature, and ministerial 
training. Over the years he and other leaders retrained the entire missionary force in 
understanding the nature of indigenous church principles and how to apply them. 
Not surprisingly, this changed the relationship of missionaries with national church 
leaders from one of paternal control to partnership.

[26] At the same time, charitable institutions continued and new ones developed; 
gradually the Assemblies of God developed a holistic theology of mission. In this 
respect, the practice of its mission program has been a pilgrimage: a long-standing 
resolve to be true to the Great Commission, along with a search to understand its 
implications for caring for the impoverished and despised.
Hodges contributed to the education of thousands of missionaries (both Pente-
costal and non-Pentecostal), who in turn prepared many more thousands of pastors, 
evangelists, and church workers. In addition, he became the leading Pentecostal mis-
siologist and the fi  rst to be published outside of denominational publications; his 
public became worldwide.
At sixty-four years of age and after twenty years’ service as fi  eld secretary, he

Marcella Dorff grew up in Fargo, North Dakota, and 
enrolled at North Central Bible College in Minneapolis, Min-
nesota. From the time of her conversion, she heard the call to 
missions. While still in Fargo, she had a vision while in prayer 
and saw “brown skinned people coming down a mountain to 
hear the Word and they were so happy.” At North Central her 
interest grew, but she hesitated to tell anyone lest her dream 
not come true. She asked the Lord to give her a sign by hav-
ing someone else confi  rm the call to her.
During her junior year, the Lord impressed on her the 
spiritual needs of Indonesia. Reminding Him of her request, 
she suddenly remembered the fate of Zechariah, father of John the Baptist, who also 
demanded a sign (Luke 1:18–20). “Icy chills ran down my back,” she remembered, “and

a fl  ash it was made plain what God was trying to show me and I  said ‘Yes, [that] 
I believed it was God’s will and I would tell others about my call.’”
Finishing her studies, Dorff went to Owatonna, Min nesota, and spent fi ve years 
pioneering an Assemblies of God church. Lessons of faith learned there prepared her 
for the mission fi  eld. On one occasion she asked a real estate agent to help her fi nd 
a new place of worship with only ten dollars “between [me] and the church.” A house 
was purchased, and nine months later so were several lots for the construction of a 
church building—“God helped us to meet every payment.”

Dorff departed for Indonesia in December 1952. Visiting Gambangwaluh in a 
remote area sometime later, she saw people walking down mountain paths to attend 
the church there. Observing this, she said, “I was reminded of what I had seen when 
I was fi rst saved.”
In 1955, she opened a Bible institute in Malang, East Java. Several months  later, 
Margaret Brown joined her and thus began a successful partnership. In addition to 
the normal activities required in such schools, they supervised student church plant-
ing in the area. Spending almost forty years each in Bible school teaching and admin-
istration, they trained hundreds of pastors and church leaders and left their mark 
on the Indonesian Assemblies of God. When it was decided that a male national

[33] my fi  rst contact with The Congo in 1939 have I had reason to be more hopeful for what 
can be accomplished.” Three years later, however, as an American perceived to be a 
threat to a rebel cause, he was clubbed to death, his body taken fi  fty miles into the 
jungle, and thrown into the crocodile-infested Bomokandi River.
After the Belgian Congo was granted independence, civil war had broken out. 
Well aware of the risk involved, Jay and Angeline Tucker left the capital, Leopoldville 
(now Kinshasha), where it was safer, and returned with their children to the city of 
Paulis (now Isiro). Both had been hesitant about returning. But one night while still 
in the capital, Angeline had gone into the room where their children were sleeping. 
“Lord, what shall we do?” she prayed, “What about taking them into this area?” At

[34] “Lord, what shall we do?” she prayed, “What about taking them into this area?” At 
that moment, she heard His answer: “I promise to deliver these children, not from, 
but out of the den of lions.” Angeline and Jay did not yet know that the rebels called 
themselves “simbas”—Swahili for “lions.” 
The rebel Simbas eventually took control of Paulis, placing the Tuckers and other 
Westerners under house arrest. Then the rebels took Jay into custody and held him, 
with other hostages, in a Catholic mission. Fearing an attack by American and Bel-
gian paratroopers, the insurgents hardened their attitudes toward the prisoners. 
Several days passed. Angeline had received no word about her husband. Finally she 
telephoned the mission to inquire about his welfare. In guarded words, “the Mother 
Superior . . . said, ‘Well, things are going along.’ I said, ‘How is my husband?’ She 
answered in French, ‘He is in heaven.’”

America and settled in Springfi  eld, Missouri. Angeline later served in the national 
Women’s Missionary Council (later, the Women’s Ministries Department).

The doctors said overwork caused his physical and mental breakdown in 1932, 
which required him to leave India. To this could be added the toll on his health taken 
by malaria. Without doubting the truthfulness of these explanations, he also knew 
“that God allowed me to pass through a nervous breakdown, and immediately after 
delivering me, illuminated my mind to picture and understand something of our 
Lord’s experiences in the garden, and their bearing on the nature of redemption’s 
victory.”
Like John of the Cross, a sixteenth-century mystic, Cummings began to expe-
rience the descent into the “dark night of the soul.” For the fi  rst three months, he 
seemed to lose all willpower and “became the prey of the most terribly vile and 
blasphemous evil powers. . . . Horrible and obscene suggestions and imaginations

[37] blasphemous evil powers. . . . Horrible and obscene suggestions and imaginations 
poured in an unceasing fl  ood through my consciousness.” Sleep became impossi-
ble without medication. Finally, “I felt as though I had been dragged through the 
sewers of hell.” All of the joys he had experienced in the Holy Spirit had now left 
him.
His worst fears were soon realized: The devil seemed to ask him, “Do you think, 
after the Lord has fi lled you once, and now that I have trapped you and fl ooded your 
soul with all this evil, that the Lord could ever cleanse you and take you back again?” 
Reluctantly, he agreed, believing that he had committed the unpardonable sin; all 
hope had vanished. In the words of John of the Cross, “The soul feels itself to be so 
impure and miserable that it believes God to be against it, and thinks that it has set 
itself up against God . . . that God has cast it away.”
After two years of suffering, which included time spent in New York mental hos-

[38] itself up against God . . . that God has cast it away.”
After two years of suffering, which included time spent in New York mental hos-
pitals, Cummings began to listen and internalize the Scripture promise pressed on 
him by several friends: “I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee” (Hebrews 13:5). For 
the fi  rst time in two years, on October 4, 1934, he fell to his knees and began to pray: 
“‘Lord,’ I said, ‘I am ashamed even to get into an attitude of prayer. I have been so 
resentful. My mind and heart and being have been so fi  lled with things which must be 
more repulsive to Thee than they are to me. I know now that there is no hope for me. 
I don’t believe you could ever take me back. But, Lord, I wonder if I could be wrong? 
You see in what terrible darkness and hopelessness every moment of my experience 
is spent. Lord, if there is anything you can do for me, won’t you do it? I would pray

[39] You see in what terrible darkness and hopelessness every moment of my experience 
is spent. Lord, if there is anything you can do for me, won’t you do it? I would pray 
if I could, but I can’t pray. There are no words to describe what I feel. Anyway, I don’t 
even feel. My heart is like a lump of stone.’”
He remembered that deep in his consciousness “a chorus began to sing.” It was 
line 2 of the song “In Jesus” that suddenly became illuminated with meaning. Written 
by James Procter, a former atheist who became a Christian, it reads:
My soul is night, my heart is steel;
I cannot see, I cannot feel;
For light, for life, I must appeal
In simple faith to Jesus.

[40] Then, “as the last word sang itself out in the silence of my heart, I knew HE stood 
with me. He gathered me in His arms and brought me into a place of nearness that 
I had never known before. His precious blood cleansed away all the stain and sin, all

Sometime later, while staying in New York City, Cummings rose early one morn-
ing. “While I was praying,” he recalled, “it seemed as though God took me by the hand 
into the garden of His agony, and showed me His Son there. My mind was astonished 
at what I saw. The Son of God appeared to be crushed. It seemed that He could not 
stand the horror of the thing that confronted Him.” Asking God what could have been

[41] in the cup that nearly overwhelmed Jesus, the Lord replied, “Do you not remember 
the terror through which you passed during the fi  rst months of your nervous break-
down? Do you not remember calling out, ‘O God, it is impossible for me to endure 
another moment of this awful horror’? I was allowing you to taste a little, a very little, 
of the cup that My Son drank to its dregs, the cup of the world’s iniquity and sin.” 
In the early 1940s the Cummingses became affi  liated with the Assemblies of God 
and were invited to join the CBI faculty, Bob as director of missions and Mid as an 
instructor in English and Hindi. 
For the rest of his life and ministry, Cummings shared his insights into Christ’s 
sufferings in Gethsemane. Along with his uncommon discernment in the operation 
of the gifts of the Spirit in worship, his message of Christ as the sin-bearer for the 
redemption of lost humanity left a deep imprint on many Pentecostals, especially his 
students.

continuing in the ministry; and the popular “I’m Going Higher,” after seeing an air-
plane overhead (an uncommon sight in 1923). This last song became popular in 
youth services. The song leader would sometimes have the audience sing the chorus 
of the song seated, then standing, and fi  nally mounted on their chairs (on outings, 
they might stand on picnic tables).
Buffum’s compositions touched the chords of joy and sorrow in the Christian life 
and often reminded believers of their heavenly hope. In many ways, he shaped early 
twentieth-century evangelical and Pentecostal worship patterns. He had no formal 
training in music; nevertheless, his self-instruction and unusual ability enabled him 
to learn virtually any keyboard or stringed instrument.
With enormous powers of concentration, Buffum could write songs (music and

[48] With enormous powers of concentration, Buffum could write songs (music and 
lyrics) during church services, in hotel lobbies, on trains, and in train stations, even 
while his four children climbed all over him. According to his daughter Lois, only 
one thing could throw off his concentration: singing another song. If no piano was 
available, Buffum would improvise on a table or another piece of furniture and tap 
out the song. He would even invite congregations to get into the act. First, he would 
have them suggest song titles. Writing the suggestions on a chalkboard, he would 
then have them vote on their top choice. Finally, he would compose a matching song 
on the spot.
In Huntington Beach, California, an eleven-year-old girl suggested the title 
“When I Take My Vacation in Heaven.” Although the congregation didn’t choose this 
one, Buffum was intrigued by it. By the next morning, he had composed the song.

[49] “When I Take My Vacation in Heaven.” Although the congregation didn’t choose this

Although he usually sold the rights to a song for fi  ve dollars—just enough for food 
and basic expenses—he sold this one for one hundred dollars; it became immensely 
popular, moving into the secular market.
The life and ministry of Herbert Buffum epitomizes the church’s troubadour, 
those who itinerated with the gospel in song. Their melodies and choruses not only 
enriched worship, they also infl  uenced day-to-day life, leaving a lyric in the heart that 
enabled the believer to maintain a walk of faith. Their legacy of music blessed gener-
ations of people in all walks of life in congregations around the world.

[51] time with the Assemblies of God as an evangelist (1919–1922). Her stature became 
such in the denomination that at the 1920 General Council meeting in Springfi  eld, 
Missouri, Sister preached in four evening services and held an afternoon healing ser-
vice. In so doing, she became one of the few women to preach at a Council and the 
only one in the denomination’s history to ever speak in more than one service. 
Yet McPherson refused to limit her ministry to a single constituency. She boldly 
carried her “foursquare gospel” (a creative adaptation of the terms fourfold gospel 
and full gospel: Jesus as Savior, Healer, Baptizer, and coming King) wherever she 
went, to “red and yellow, black and white,” as well as rich or poor.
What made her ministry so effective? There were many reasons. People fl  ocked 
to her services around the country because they needed healing or simply went with 
friends and relatives who did. Preaching the great “I  Am,” she struck a responsive

[52] Foursquare Church and the Assemblies of God. 
Whether she was preaching and praying for the sick in Denver, Wichita, San Jose, 
Baltimore, Philadelphia, Rochester, Tampa, or Toronto, revival followed. The impact 
of her campaigns also jump-started many struggling little Pentecostal churches. 
Her journey “From Milkpail to Pulpit”—with its drama and pathos, its triumphs 
and failures, its laughter and tears—held her listeners at the edge of their seats 
because it resembled their stories too, or at least one they wished for themselves. 
But while she inspired their imaginations, she couldn’t share the rest of her story. 
At times, McPherson’s public persona masked a painful loneliness. In 1911, 
a year after returning from China, she married divorcé Harold McPherson, who 
appeared to offer her the security she needed. Two years later, she gave birth to 
their son, Rolf. Domesticity, however, soon frustrated her intense burden for evan-

[53] by the world famous Pandita Ramabai, a high-caste Hindu convert to Christianity, 
the mission housed hundreds of widows and orphans and provided relief to famine 
victims. Called the “George Müller of India” because of her faith in God and her char-
itable ministries, Ramabai needed help in administering the operation and quickly 
accepted Abrams’s offer. 
Infl uenced by the higher life teachings of the Keswick conferences in England, Ram-
abai, along with other Christians, prayed for the outpouring of the Spirit. In this, she 
was joined by Abrams, whose views on the sanctifi  ed life refl  ected a distinctly Wesleyan 
orientation. After word reached India in 1904 telling of the revival in Wales, revival broke 
out the next year at mission stations in the Khassia Hills of northeast India staffed by 
Welsh Presbyterian missionaries. Believers there began intensely confessing their sins

try. “People who are poor, sick, and hungry need more than money, health, and food,” 
she wrote in 1990. “Like us all, they need meaning in life—a sense of order, a reason 
for living. This is where Christians have so much to offer. If you help people fi nd the 
meaning of life while helping them fi nd a home or get a job, you are helping them at 
the deepest level.”
ROBERT E. COOLEY 
(1930–)
A number of Assemblies of God scholars like Billie Davis 
have made signifi  cant academic contributions. To the hall of 
fame must be added the name of Robert E. Cooley. He was 
born into a pastor’s home in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and his 
father later served as Michigan district superintendent. In 
1952, he married Eilene Carlson and received ordination from 
the Michigan district six years later.
Academic training for the ministry took him from Central

[2] Educators presented in this chapter include Peter C. Nelson, Myer Pearlman, 
Marcus L. Grable, Christine Gibson, and Stanley H. Frodsham. Gibson, founder of 
the independent Zion Bible Institute in Rhode Island, never held credentials with the 
General Council. Yet hundreds of Assemblies of God ministers received their training 
there; her story deserves to be told. Stanley H. Frodsham, long-time editor of the 
Pentecostal Evangel, has also been included. While he did some teaching at CBI, his 
contributions lie in his editorial work and many books. Through these means, he 
contributed to ministerial preparation formally and informally. Many who couldn’t 
attend the Bible institutes depended on the Evangel for instruction, sermon ideas, 
and Sunday School lessons.
PETER C. NELSON
(1868–1942)
Generally, Pentecostals looked down on academic degrees as more of a hindrance 
than help for Spirit-fi  lled ministry. For example, one early Council leader recalled,

[3] buildings: churches, post offi  ces, government offi  ces, libraries, schools. Since they 
were free and open to the public, each one made a profound impact on her life. Hav-
ing gotten permission from her mother to attend a Sunday School class, Davis heard 
the teacher say that Jesus loved her. Now she had not only sat on a chair for the fi rst 
time, she had found hope. “It was the fi  rst time I saw a way out of the fatalism of 
the campgrounds,” she refl  ected. “The rich get richer, the poor get poorer, everybody 
pushes you down, you don’t have a chance. But in Sunday School they said you did
have a chance, because you’re a child of God.”
Libraries opened a whole new world for her, and the public school promised 
her the same education that every other child received. After Davis’s family settled 
down during World War II, she graduated from high school as the valedictorian of her 
class and began working at an aircraft factory in San Diego. Having edited her high

school paper, she dreamed of becoming a journalist and wrote to the national Sun-
day School Department in Springfi  eld. Learning of her interest in writing and editing, 
Marcus Grable invited her to assist with the new Sunday School Counselor magazine.
Only nineteen and having a single change of clothes, she arrived in Springfi eld in 
the early 1940s to collect sixteen dollars a week at headquarters. Giving up plans to

Drury College (now University). It was during this time that she met George Davis, a

They went to Costa Rica as missionaries in 1957 and eventually were assigned to pro-

Years later, Davis graduated with highest honors from Drury and capped her

Cooley’s inauguration as president of Gordon-Conwell Theo-
logical Seminary in 1981 marked a milestone in North American 
Pentecostalism. “‘Historic’ . . . seemed a tame term,” mused Rus-

which had begun in 1942 with membership in the National Asso-

Miranda grew up in an unpromising environment: a poor barrio in Albuquerque, 
New Mexico, one of fi ve children born to a sawmill worker who had emigrated from 
Chihuahua State in Mexico and a mother of Spanish descent. He came to Christ at 
an early age after members of a nearby Pentecostal church, who had heard that his 
mother was sick, came to the house and prayed for her. Her healing had a dramatic 
effect on the family and young Jesse. 
The church had been in contact with the family for two years before the healing. 
“This little Pentecostal church would come in an old broken-down-bus, pick us up, 
and take me to church—that made the difference,” Miranda recalled. It was at church 
that he learned to write. At Christmastime, when his parents gave clothes as presents

as an example: Joe E. Martinez, an Assemblies of God layman and professor at the 
University of New Mexico. “That’s the image that stuck.”

[15] His parents—a Catholic father and mainline Protestant mother—also mentored 
him in the importance of reconciliation. “I remember I was 13 or 14, and I said, ‘Dad, 
Catholics never read the Bible,’ because I never saw him read it. ‘Mother, you read the 
Bible but never come to the book of Acts.’ And then they would turn around and say, 
‘And you Pentecostals never leave the Book of Acts.’ So I saw my shortcomings and 
I saw differences. Yet we loved and respected one another so that we really enjoyed 
our fellowship. And we all affi  rmed one another.” 
At age sixteen, he began to attend Bible school, and his pastor assigned him 
preaching responsibilities a year later. Like other young people who demonstrated

n late summer 1930, William I. Evans, the “principal” of Central Bible Institute 
(CBI) announced that the school year would begin on September 26, and there 
was still room for more students. “We are looking for Jesus to come and, in conse-
quence of that glorious event, we may never conduct the [term],” he remarked. “We 
thank God for the blessed hope. . . . However, we are occupying till He comes. That 
occupation with us is making this Institute count for the very most in the advance-
ment of the Kingdom.” The school preferred mature and “diligent students of the 
Word,” nineteen years of age and older. Accepting applicants below this age might 
mean that at graduation three years later, they could still be “too young to be trusted 
with the responsibilities involved.”

[20] Evans lamented that fi  nding students with the “highest type of consecration 
among us is getting rarer.” Life at a Bible institute contrasted sharply with campus 
life at colleges and universities. Preeminently an experience in spiritual formation, it 
demanded a high level of dedication to stay the course.
The “standards of holiness” required separation from worldly values. “It grieves 
our hearts and we could weep,” he added in disappointment, “when we see world 
conformity among Bible school graduates!” Women especially seem to have been 
the culprits: “We have seen pastors’ wives and lady pastors and leaders dressed so 
much like the world as to show no line of separation.” Hence, “short skirts, low necks, 
sheer clothes, adornments, and worldly style of hair dress, are inexcusable. Certainly 
religion does not consist in what we wear, but genuine religion of the kind we profess

[21] religion does not consist in what we wear, but genuine religion of the kind we profess 
will show itself in these matters.” Hopefully, “only . . . serious-minded youths will 
care to apply themselves to [the school’s] rigor.” 
Although strict discipline characterized all the schools, the atmosphere could 
hardly be described as dull or without humor. Instead, both students and faculty 
members shared a common commitment for the evangelization of the world. Refl ect-
ing the desire of church leaders and grassroots believers alike, Evans pleaded, “We 
want all its facilities from walls and roof to the services of consecrated instructors to 
produce the very utmost in lives for the Kingdom.”

[22] PEOPLE OF THE SPIRIT
Alumni from Assemblies of God schools often recall classroom instructors who 
profoundly impacted their lives. Since these institutions were ventures of faith, fac-
ulty members worked long hours, struggled with low pay, and frequently received lit-
tle recognition for their sacrifi cial efforts. In a report published in the Pentecostal Evan-
gel about the 1937 commencement at Latin American Bible Institute in San Antonio 
and the thirty-fi  ve men and women who graduated, the writer attributed the success 
of the school to the sacrifi  ces of the staff: “Much credit is due to Brother Ball and the 
group of workers who have been assisting him as teachers in the school, since funds 
have never been very plentiful so as to enable anyone to be really remunerated for 
his services; but each has given his time and effort willingly as unto the Lord, trusting 
God for the supply of his individual needs.”

[23] his services; but each has given his time and effort willingly as unto the Lord, trusting 
God for the supply of his individual needs.”
Most churches did not fi  nancially support these schools for several reasons: 
First, they sometimes preferred spending their monies on local church ministries 
and/or foreign missions. Second, a long-standing fear of educational preparation 
made many wary of Bible institutes. Third, since the schools operated on faith, God 
would somehow provide for them; indeed, strong fi  nancial backing might jeopardize 
their spiritual vigor. Despite the handicaps that worked against their effectiveness, 
teachers contributed heavily to the spiritual formation of thousands of pastors, evan-
gelists, missionaries, and other church workers.

several states of this country, young men and women will gather in for another year 
of study and training for the ministry among their own Spanish-speaking people. Year

condition at the homes of the students will prevent many of them from coming to school

As we bring this urgent need before our Evangel readers, we trust the Lord will 
lay it upon some hearts to help, for we believe that funds invested in the school will 
yield good dividends in the Kingdom of God. Offerings may be sent to the Foreign Mis-

Bryant’s infl  uence. Enrolling at a Baptist seminary in the Chicago area a year later, he 
found that without an undergraduate degree he was not prepared, so he switched to 
Denison University in Ohio. To cover his expenses, he worked as a manual laborer. 
While there he met his wife, Myrtle Garmong, who then helped him complete the 
program (in seven years).
Still feeling unprepared, he enrolled at Rochester Seminary in 1899. Augustus 
H. Strong, the president and professor of theology, taught the courses in systematic 
theology, and Nelson became one of his students. Strong’s Systematic Theology, fi  rst 
published in 1886, had gone through seven editions and reached nearly twelve hun-
dred pages by the time he got there. “I have discarded none of the Baptist  doctrines,” 
he reminisced many years later, “but have built a story or two on the good solid foun-

[28] he reminisced many years later, “but have built a story or two on the good solid foun-

Following graduation, he evangelized and pastored several churches before 
being called to pastor Conley Memorial Baptist Church in Detroit. His contact with 
Pentecostals began in 1920, but they failed to impress him. Nevertheless, a healing 
from a serious and possibly life-threatening infection led him to begin preaching on 
divine healing. But the congregation refused to accept this new teaching, and before 
long he resigned. Shortly after, he was baptized in the Spirit and joined the Assem-
blies of God. 
By now over fi  fty years old and a seasoned minister, he detected that many young 
people in the Assemblies of God were entering the ministry just like he had: with little 
preparation. In 1927 he moved to Enid, Oklahoma, where he founded a church and

MYER PEARLMAN
(1898–1943)
The personalities in this chapter came from widely different backgrounds, and 
Myer Pearlman was no exception. The eldest son of a 
Jewish family, he studied at a synagogue school in Bir-
mingham, England. In school he remembered learning 
the Jewish version of the three R’s: the Jewish faith, the 
Torah (Old Testament), and the Hebrew language. “I was 
taught,” he recalled, “that while I  was to be a patriotic 
Englishman, I was also a Jew, a member of the nation, and 
that I was different from other people. I remember passing 
meat markets, and inwardly thanking God that I did not 
eat unclean meat.”
The economic situation in England forced his  father 
to move the family to the United States in hopes of gain-

[32] meat markets, and inwardly thanking God that I did not 
eat unclean meat.”
The economic situation in England forced his  father 
to move the family to the United States in hopes of gain-
ing employment and improving their living standard. After settling in New York City in 
1915, the younger Pearlman eventually enlisted in the U.S. Army and served eighteen 
months in the medical corps in France. His profi ciency in French helped him in this 
capacity. After the war, he traveled to California where “groping for light I began to 
read religious books and attend services.” 
Sometime later, walking by a mission in San Francisco, he noticed a crowd gath-
ered at the entrance and stopped to listen to the music. On another evening, he 
stood outside again. Mustering his courage, he entered and took a seat. He was par-
ticularly impressed by the music, especially the song “Honey in the Rock,” written by 
F.A. Graves. Based on Deuteronomy 32:13 (“he nourished [Israel] with honey from

[33] ticularly impressed by the music, especially the song “Honey in the Rock,” written by 
F.A. Graves. Based on Deuteronomy 32:13 (“he nourished [Israel] with honey from 
the rock”), it tells of God’s grace and provision from an unexpected source. Verse two 
asks, “Have you ‘tasted that the Lord is gracious?’ Do you walk in the way that’s new? 
Have you drunk from the living fountain? There’s Honey in the Rock [Jesus Christ] 
for you.” Attending nightly, he eventually confessed his sins and became a Christian, 
praying “in the name of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.”
In 1922, Pearlman enrolled at Central Bible Institute, where he later met 
his wife, Irene Graves, daughter of the songwriter. A brilliant student and self-
taught in many areas, he read the Scriptures in Hebrew, Greek, Spanish, French, 
and Italian. At graduation time, the principal, Frank M. Boyd, invited him to join 
the faculty. Pearlman accepted and taught there from 1924 until his death in 1943.

try. “People who are poor, sick, and hungry need more than money, health, and food,” 
she wrote in 1990. “Like us all, they need meaning in life—a sense of order, a reason 
for living. This is where Christians have so much to offer. If you help people fi nd the

ROBERT E. COOLEY 
(1930–)
A number of Assemblies of God scholars like Billie Davis 
have made signifi  cant academic contributions. To the hall of 
fame must be added the name of Robert E. Cooley. He was 
born into a pastor’s home in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and his 
father later served as Michigan district superintendent. In 
1952, he married Eilene Carlson and received ordination from 
the Michigan district six years later.
Academic training for the ministry took him from Central

[2] Educators presented in this chapter include Peter C. Nelson, Myer Pearlman, 
Marcus L. Grable, Christine Gibson, and Stanley H. Frodsham. Gibson, founder of 
the independent Zion Bible Institute in Rhode Island, never held credentials with the 
General Council. Yet hundreds of Assemblies of God ministers received their training 
there; her story deserves to be told. Stanley H. Frodsham, long-time editor of the 
Pentecostal Evangel, has also been included. While he did some teaching at CBI, his 
contributions lie in his editorial work and many books. Through these means, he 
contributed to ministerial preparation formally and informally. Many who couldn’t 
attend the Bible institutes depended on the Evangel for instruction, sermon ideas, 
and Sunday School lessons.
PETER C. NELSON
(1868–1942)
Generally, Pentecostals looked down on academic degrees as more of a hindrance 
than help for Spirit-fi  lled ministry. For example, one early Council leader recalled,

[3] buildings: churches, post offi  ces, government offi  ces, libraries, schools. Since they 
were free and open to the public, each one made a profound impact on her life. Hav-
ing gotten permission from her mother to attend a Sunday School class, Davis heard 
the teacher say that Jesus loved her. Now she had not only sat on a chair for the fi rst 
time, she had found hope. “It was the fi  rst time I saw a way out of the fatalism of 
the campgrounds,” she refl  ected. “The rich get richer, the poor get poorer, everybody 
pushes you down, you don’t have a chance. But in Sunday School they said you did
have a chance, because you’re a child of God.”
Libraries opened a whole new world for her, and the public school promised 
her the same education that every other child received. After Davis’s family settled 
down during World War II, she graduated from high school as the valedictorian of her 
class and began working at an aircraft factory in San Diego. Having edited her high

[4] down during World War II, she graduated from high school as the valedictorian of her 
class and began working at an aircraft factory in San Diego. Having edited her high 
school paper, she dreamed of becoming a journalist and wrote to the national Sun-
day School Department in Springfi  eld. Learning of her interest in writing and editing, 
Marcus Grable invited her to assist with the new Sunday School Counselor magazine.
Only nineteen and having a single change of clothes, she arrived in Springfi eld in 
the early 1940s to collect sixteen dollars a week at headquarters. Giving up plans to 
study at the University of Missouri School of Journalism, she began taking classes at

Drury College (now University). It was during this time that she met George Davis, a 
student at Central Bible College. Married in 1945, she was ordained three years later. 
They went to Costa Rica as missionaries in 1957 and eventually were assigned to pro-
mote Sunday Schools throughout Latin America. With George’s skill as a pilot, they 
fl  ew extensively about the region to workshops and conferences.
Years later, Davis graduated with highest honors from Drury and capped her 
training with a doctorate in education at the University of Miami in Florida. Hoping to 
enter a sociology program, she discovered that the university did not offer a doctor-
ate in that area. Finally, she decided to visit the Education Department to see if they

Cooley’s inauguration as president of Gordon-Conwell Theo-
logical Seminary in 1981 marked a milestone in North American 
Pentecostalism. “‘Historic’ . . . seemed a tame term,” mused Rus-
sell P . Spittler, a leading theologian in the Council. “A minister of 
the Assemblies of God becomes the head of a leading evangelical 
seminary reaching the conclusion of its fi  rst century of service.” 
The welding of establishment Pentecostalism to evangelicalism, 
which had begun in 1942 with membership in the National Asso-

Protestantism.” Founder of the National Alliance of Evangelical Ministries (AMEN, 
Alianza de Ministerios Evangélicos Nacionales), advisor to three American presi-

Miranda grew up in an unpromising environment: a poor barrio in Albuquerque, 
New Mexico, one of fi ve children born to a sawmill worker who had emigrated from 
Chihuahua State in Mexico and a mother of Spanish descent. He came to Christ at 
an early age after members of a nearby Pentecostal church, who had heard that his 
mother was sick, came to the house and prayed for her. Her healing had a dramatic 
effect on the family and young Jesse. 
The church had been in contact with the family for two years before the healing. 
“This little Pentecostal church would come in an old broken-down-bus, pick us up, 
and take me to church—that made the difference,” Miranda recalled. It was at church 
that he learned to write. At Christmastime, when his parents gave clothes as presents

While growing up, the disciplined lifestyle of his father and the spiritual encour-
agement of his mother strongly infl  uenced him. On one occasion, during a church 
service, his mother put her arm around him and told him that she wanted him to 
become an educated man. She then pointed to a man kneeling at the altar in prayer 
as an example: Joe E. Martinez, an Assemblies of God layman and professor at the 
University of New Mexico. “That’s the image that stuck.”

[15] His parents—a Catholic father and mainline Protestant mother—also mentored 
him in the importance of reconciliation. “I remember I was 13 or 14, and I said, ‘Dad, 
Catholics never read the Bible,’ because I never saw him read it. ‘Mother, you read the 
Bible but never come to the book of Acts.’ And then they would turn around and say, 
‘And you Pentecostals never leave the Book of Acts.’ So I saw my shortcomings and 
I saw differences. Yet we loved and respected one another so that we really enjoyed 
our fellowship. And we all affi  rmed one another.” 
At age sixteen, he began to attend Bible school, and his pastor assigned him 
preaching responsibilities a year later. Like other young people who demonstrated 
leadership abilities in Pentecostal churches, his pastor gave him opportunities to

n late summer 1930, William I. Evans, the “principal” of Central Bible Institute 
(CBI) announced that the school year would begin on September 26, and there 
was still room for more students. “We are looking for Jesus to come and, in conse-
quence of that glorious event, we may never conduct the [term],” he remarked. “We 
thank God for the blessed hope. . . . However, we are occupying till He comes. That 
occupation with us is making this Institute count for the very most in the advance-
ment of the Kingdom.” The school preferred mature and “diligent students of the 
Word,” nineteen years of age and older. Accepting applicants below this age might 
mean that at graduation three years later, they could still be “too young to be trusted 
with the responsibilities involved.”

[20] Evans lamented that fi  nding students with the “highest type of consecration 
among us is getting rarer.” Life at a Bible institute contrasted sharply with campus 
life at colleges and universities. Preeminently an experience in spiritual formation, it 
demanded a high level of dedication to stay the course.
The “standards of holiness” required separation from worldly values. “It grieves 
our hearts and we could weep,” he added in disappointment, “when we see world 
conformity among Bible school graduates!” Women especially seem to have been 
the culprits: “We have seen pastors’ wives and lady pastors and leaders dressed so 
much like the world as to show no line of separation.” Hence, “short skirts, low necks, 
sheer clothes, adornments, and worldly style of hair dress, are inexcusable. Certainly 
religion does not consist in what we wear, but genuine religion of the kind we profess

[21] religion does not consist in what we wear, but genuine religion of the kind we profess 
will show itself in these matters.” Hopefully, “only . . . serious-minded youths will 
care to apply themselves to [the school’s] rigor.” 
Although strict discipline characterized all the schools, the atmosphere could 
hardly be described as dull or without humor. Instead, both students and faculty 
members shared a common commitment for the evangelization of the world. Refl ect-
ing the desire of church leaders and grassroots believers alike, Evans pleaded, “We 
want all its facilities from walls and roof to the services of consecrated instructors to 
produce the very utmost in lives for the Kingdom.”

tle recognition for their sacrifi cial efforts. In a report published in the Pentecostal Evan-
gel about the 1937 commencement at Latin American Bible Institute in San Antonio 
and the thirty-fi  ve men and women who graduated, the writer attributed the success 
of the school to the sacrifi  ces of the staff: “Much credit is due to Brother Ball and the 
group of workers who have been assisting him as teachers in the school, since funds 
have never been very plentiful so as to enable anyone to be really remunerated for 
his services; but each has given his time and effort willingly as unto the Lord, trusting 
God for the supply of his individual needs.”

God for the supply of his individual needs.”
Most churches did not fi  nancially support these schools for several reasons: 
First, they sometimes preferred spending their monies on local church ministries 
and/or foreign missions. Second, a long-standing fear of educational preparation 
made many wary of Bible institutes. Third, since the schools operated on faith, God 
would somehow provide for them; indeed, strong fi  nancial backing might jeopardize 
their spiritual vigor. Despite the handicaps that worked against their effectiveness, 
teachers contributed heavily to the spiritual formation of thousands of pastors, evan-
gelists, missionaries, and other church workers.

Bryant’s infl  uence. Enrolling at a Baptist seminary in the Chicago area a year later, he 
found that without an undergraduate degree he was not prepared, so he switched to 
Denison University in Ohio. To cover his expenses, he worked as a manual laborer. 
While there he met his wife, Myrtle Garmong, who then helped him complete the 
program (in seven years).
Still feeling unprepared, he enrolled at Rochester Seminary in 1899. Augustus 
H. Strong, the president and professor of theology, taught the courses in systematic 
theology, and Nelson became one of his students. Strong’s Systematic Theology, fi  rst 
published in 1886, had gone through seven editions and reached nearly twelve hun-
dred pages by the time he got there. “I have discarded none of the Baptist  doctrines,” 
he reminisced many years later, “but have built a story or two on the good solid foun-

[28] he reminisced many years later, “but have built a story or two on the good solid foun-
dation laid for our faith.”
Following graduation, he evangelized and pastored several churches before 
being called to pastor Conley Memorial Baptist Church in Detroit. His contact with 
Pentecostals began in 1920, but they failed to impress him. Nevertheless, a healing 
from a serious and possibly life-threatening infection led him to begin preaching on 
divine healing. But the congregation refused to accept this new teaching, and before 
long he resigned. Shortly after, he was baptized in the Spirit and joined the Assem-
blies of God. 
By now over fi  fty years old and a seasoned minister, he detected that many young 
people in the Assemblies of God were entering the ministry just like he had: with little 
preparation. In 1927 he moved to Enid, Oklahoma, where he founded a church and

MYER PEARLMAN
(1898–1943)
The personalities in this chapter came from widely different backgrounds, and 
Myer Pearlman was no exception. The eldest son of a 
Jewish family, he studied at a synagogue school in Bir-
mingham, England. In school he remembered learning 
the Jewish version of the three R’s: the Jewish faith, the 
Torah (Old Testament), and the Hebrew language. “I was 
taught,” he recalled, “that while I  was to be a patriotic 
Englishman, I was also a Jew, a member of the nation, and 
that I was different from other people. I remember passing 
meat markets, and inwardly thanking God that I did not 
eat unclean meat.”
The economic situation in England forced his  father 
to move the family to the United States in hopes of gain-

[32] meat markets, and inwardly thanking God that I did not 
eat unclean meat.”
The economic situation in England forced his  father 
to move the family to the United States in hopes of gain-
ing employment and improving their living standard. After settling in New York City in 
1915, the younger Pearlman eventually enlisted in the U.S. Army and served eighteen 
months in the medical corps in France. His profi ciency in French helped him in this 
capacity. After the war, he traveled to California where “groping for light I began to 
read religious books and attend services.” 
Sometime later, walking by a mission in San Francisco, he noticed a crowd gath-
ered at the entrance and stopped to listen to the music. On another evening, he 
stood outside again. Mustering his courage, he entered and took a seat. He was par-
ticularly impressed by the music, especially the song “Honey in the Rock,” written by 
F.A. Graves. Based on Deuteronomy 32:13 (“he nourished [Israel] with honey from

[33] ticularly impressed by the music, especially the song “Honey in the Rock,” written by 
F.A. Graves. Based on Deuteronomy 32:13 (“he nourished [Israel] with honey from 
the rock”), it tells of God’s grace and provision from an unexpected source. Verse two 
asks, “Have you ‘tasted that the Lord is gracious?’ Do you walk in the way that’s new? 
Have you drunk from the living fountain? There’s Honey in the Rock [Jesus Christ] 
for you.” Attending nightly, he eventually confessed his sins and became a Christian, 
praying “in the name of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.”
In 1922, Pearlman enrolled at Central Bible Institute, where he later met 
his wife, Irene Graves, daughter of the songwriter. A brilliant student and self-
taught in many areas, he read the Scriptures in Hebrew, Greek, Spanish, French, 
and Italian. At graduation time, the principal, Frank M. Boyd, invited him to join 
the faculty. Pearlman accepted and taught there from 1924 until his death in 1943.

[35] dice and to reconcile social antagonism. The church may offer the world a privatized, 
personal, and ‘spiritual’ brand of Christianity, or it can provide leadership toward a 
more just and humane society exemplifying the kingdom of God.”
Christianity Today noted, “Since the days of playing in backyard junk cars [in the 
barrio], he has not stopped envisioning a better future. Now, he says, his dream is 
that his children and grandchildren will live and work among a broader Christian 
community as a result of his bridge-building.”
The varied endeavors of the persons introduced in this chapter represent the 
notable work of Christian mentors. Paul, too, recognized the value of mentoring when 
he advised his understudy Timothy to “be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus; 
and what you have heard from me through many witnesses entrust to faithful people 
who will be able to teach others as well” (2 Timothy 2:1–2, NRSV).

Over the course of years, he authored three books, wrote hundreds of articles for 
the Evangel and other headquarters’ publications, and became a popular speaker at 
writers’ conferences around the world. Like the Old Testament prophet Habakkuk, he 
told his staff, as well as aspiring writers, that the nature of their work required them 
to “write the vision, and make it plain” (Habakkuk 2:2).
Those who knew Champion remember his ability to affi  rm those with whom he 
worked. When staffers submitted poor articles, he would meet with them person-
ally and review the problems. They would not only leave knowing how to make the 
needed changes, but also feeling positive about themselves and their skills. Friends 
also remember his keen wit.

9. SANCTIFICATION
Sanctifi cation is an act of separation from that which is evil, and of dedication 
unto God (Romans 12:1,2; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; Hebrews 13:12). Scriptures teach a 
life of “holiness without which no man shall see the Lord” (Hebrews 12:14). By the 
power of the Holy Spirit we are able to obey the command: “Be ye holy, for I am holy” 
(1 Peter 1:15,16).
Sanctifi cation is realized in the believer by recognizing his identifi  cation with 
Christ in His death and resurrection, and by faith reckoning daily upon the fact of that 
union, and by offering every faculty continually to the dominion of the Holy Spirit 
(Romans 6:1–11,13; 8:1,2,13; Galatians 2:20; Philippians 2:12,13; 1 Peter 1:5).
10. THE CHURCH AND ITS MISSION
The Church is the body of Christ, the habitation of God through the Spirit, with 
divine appointments for the fulfi  llment of her Great Commission. Each believer, born

T
he Bible is our all–suffi  cient rule for faith and practice. This Statement of Fun-
damental Truths is intended simply as a basis of fellowship among us (i.e., that 
we all speak the same thing, 1 Corinthians 1:10; Acts 2:42). The phraseology 
employed in this statement is not inspired or contended for, but the truth set forth 
is held to be essential to a full–gospel ministry. No claim is made that it contains all 
biblical truth, only that it covers our need as to these fundamental doctrines.
1. THE SCRIPTURES INSPIRED
The Scriptures, both the Old and New Testaments, are verbally inspired of God 
and are the revelation of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and 
conduct (2 Timothy 3:15–17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Peter 1:21).
2. THE ONE TRUE GOD
The one true God has revealed himself as the eternally self–existent “I AM,” the 
Creator of heaven and earth and the Redeemer of mankind. He has further revealed

[3] a. His virgin birth (Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:31,35). 
b. His sinless life (Hebrews 7:26; 1 Peter 2:22).
c. His miracles (Acts 2:22; 10:38).
d. His substitutionary work on the cross (1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
e. His bodily resurrection from the dead (Matthew 28:6; Luke 24:39; 1 Corinthians 
15:4).
f. His exaltation to the right hand of God (Acts 1:9,11; 2:33; Philippians 2:9–11; 
Hebrews 1:3).
4. THE FALL OF MAN
Man was created good and upright; for God said, “Let us make man in our 
image, after our likeness.” However, man by voluntary transgression fell and thereby 
incurred not only physical death but also spiritual death, which is separation from 
God (Genesis 1:26,27; 2:17; 3:6; Romans 5:12–19).
5. THE SALVATION OF MAN
Man’s only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son 
of God.

of a generation of Assemblies of God “post-Pentecostal Pen-

mote Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues.
General Superintendent Wood disputes this pessimistic 
picture in a 2014 centennial interview in Charisma magazine. 
His observations, interviews with leaders, and wide travel

tongues is alive and growing. He affi  rmed that the statistics 
are imperfect, not refl  ecting practices in thousands of churches in recent years.

[6] notes a signifi cant rise in Pentecostal practices, even among those not tradition-
ally labeled Pentecostal or charismatic. For much the evangelical world in particular, 
praying for healing and miracles, exercising spiritual gifts, trusting the Lord for deliv-
erance, and speaking in tongues are all valid biblical practices. This is a signifi  cant 
change within one generation. 
Cessationism (the belief that the manifestations of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians 
12–14 ceased with the death of the original apostles or the close of the New Testa-
ment canon in the fourth century) is a declining movement as believers of all denom-
inations and theological persuasions affi  rm the contemporary work of the Spirit. 
Though many of these groups do not share the “classical” Pentecostal distinctive 
of tongues as the initial physical evident of Spirit baptism, the affi  rmation that the

Spirit works in and through all the gifts is a heartening change. 
There are some signs across the United States that cause concern among 
thoughtful persons. The number of people that answered “none” when asked for reli-
gious affi  liation has grown from a miniscule percentage in the 1980s to 16.1  per-
cent in a 2007 poll by Pew Research. And 28 percent have left the faith they were 
raised in or affi  liate with no religion at all.
1 This refl  ects two trends: (1) the loss of 
denominational loyalty among some that might still (vaguely) identify themselves as 
Christians; and (2) an increasing number of the U.S. population (both immigrant and 
native-born) with no religious affi liation.

[8] “Post-Christian” and “postmodern” are labels tossed about with great frequency 
in popular analysis. The United States remains much more religious than most of 
Western Europe; however, “being spiritual and not religious” is gaining as a category 
of a generation without signifi  cant exposure to the gospel. 
The new challenge for Assemblies of God leaders is evangelization of people with 
no Christian memory. This is a new phenomenon for many U.S. leaders (though not 
for the appointed missionaries of AGWM). 
Another concern among thoughtful adherents is moral compromise with the 
subversion of traditional marriage and sexuality in the last half-century. The public

consensus in the West and the United States of lifelong heterosexual marriage and 
celibacy for singles is no longer the prevailing opinion of popular culture or even 
a majority of people. While strong elements within American society advocate or 
support gay marriage, the Assemblies of God stands fi  rmly committed to scriptural 
teaching that marriage is between a man and a woman.
When confronted by actual or potential compromise in other evangelical or Pen-
tecostal fellowships and organizations, steadfast adherence to biblical marriage is 
quickly affi  rmed. The Assemblies of God leadership has been uncompromising it its 
standards of sexual conduct while affi  rming love for all people broken by sin.

[10] OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD!
The evangelical revivals of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries fueled the 
birth of global missions. The Pentecostal awakenings have accelerated the spread 
of the gospel in the twentieth century. We are now witnesses the re-evangelizing of 
Europe and the United States by missional believers from developing nations. The 
gospel is now going from everywhere to everywhere as former missions fi elds become 
missions-sending agencies. 
When Melvin Hodges penned The Indigenous Church in 1953, the aim of missions was 
a self-sustaining local church and, in the long-term, a self-sustaining national fellow-
ship. These remain important goals; however, a more complete goal is emerging in the 
twenty-fi rst century: establishing churches and fellowships of churches that become 
not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata,

[11] not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around 
the world answer the Great Commission call and become “360  Churches.” Mission-
ary-scholars such as Alan Johnson in Thailand are now articulating an integration of 
apostolic pioneering and church planting united with holistic care for communities. 
In the post-Christian West, Pentecostal spirituality and theology are the answer 
for generations that are hungry for experience and meaning rooted in love and truth. 
Apologetics and careful explanations of truth must be united with the proclamation 
of the Cross and power of the Spirit to deliver, heal, forgive, redeem, and transform.

[12] Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The 
signs and wonders demonstrated in Scripture are alive and well on the frontiers of 
evangelization and missions today. The Assemblies of God has a bright future as we 
recognize those frontiers across the street and around the world.
Gary McGee’s fi nal work, Miracles, Missions and American Pentecostalism (2010), details 
the supernatural confi rmation of the missionary pioneers. As a new Spirit-empowered 
generation hears the call to evangelism, worship, discipleship, and compassion, they 
can expect the Lord of the harvest to again confi  rm the message of grace.

relationship, as to its mode is inscrutable and incomprehensible, because unexplained 
(Luke 1:35; 1 Corinthians 1:24; Matthew 11:25–27; 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14; 1 John 1:3,4).
(c) Unity of the One Being of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
Accordingly, therefore, there is that in the Father which constitutes Him the Father 
and not the Son; there is that in the Son which constitutes Him the Son and not the 
Father; and there is that in the Holy Spirit which constitutes Him the Holy Spirit and 
not either the Father or the Son. Wherefore, the Father is the Begetter; the Son is the 
Begotten; and the Holy Spirit is the One proceeding from the Father and the Son. There-
fore, because these three persons in the godhead are in a state of unity, there is but 
one Lord God Almighty and His name one (John 1:18; 15:26; 17:11,21; Zechariah 14:9).
(d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor

[14] (d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor 
confused as to relation; nor divided in respect to the godhead; nor opposed as to 
cooperation. The Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son as to relationship. 
The Son is with the Father and the Father is with the Son, as to fellowship. The Father 
is not from the Son, but the Son is from the Father, as to authority. The Holy Spirit 
is from the Father and the Son proceeding, as to nature, relationship, cooperation, 
and authority. Hence, no person in the godhead either exists or works separately or 
independently of the others (John 5:17–30,32,37; 8:17,18).
(e) The Title, Lord Jesus Christ
The appellation Lord Jesus Christ, is a proper name. It is never applied in the New 
Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us

[15] Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us
The Lord Jesus Christ, as to His divine and eternal nature, is the proper and only 
Begotten of the Father, but as to His human nature, He is the proper Son of Man. He 
is, therefore, acknowledged to be both God and man; who because He is God and 
man, is “Immanuel,” God with us (Matthew 1:23; 1 John 4:2,10,14; Revelation 1:13,17).
(g) The Title, Son of God
Since the name Immanuel embraces both God and man, in the one person, our 
Lord Jesus Christ, it follows that the title Son of God describes His proper deity, and 
the title Son of Man, His proper humanity. Therefore, the title Son of God belongs to 
the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23; 
2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).

2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).
(h) Transgression of the Doctrine of Christ
Wherefore, it is a transgression of the doctrine of Christ to say that Jesus Christ 
derived the title Son of God solely from the fact of the Incarnation, or because of His 
relation to the economy of redemption. Therefore, to deny that the Father is a real 
and eternal Father, and that the Son is a real and eternal Son, is a denial of the

a. Conditions to Salvation
Salvation is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord 
Jesus Christ. By the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, being 
justifi ed by grace through faith, man becomes an heir of God according to the hope of 
eternal life (Luke 24:47; John 3:3; Romans 10:13–15; Ephesians 2:8; Titus 2:11; 3:5–7).
b. The Evidences of Salvation
The inward evidence of salvation is the direct witness of the Spirit (Romans 8:16). 
The outward evidence to all men is a life of righteousness and true holiness (Ephe-
sians 4:24; Titus 2:12).

The Lord’s Supper, consisting of the elements—bread and the fruit of the vine—is 
the symbol expressing our sharing the divine nature of our Lord Jesus Christ (2 Peter 
1:4); a memorial of His suffering and death (1 Corinthians 11:26); and a prophecy of His 
second coming (1 Corinthians 11:26); and is enjoined on all believers “till He come!”
7. THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
All believers are entitled to and should ardently expect and earnestly seek the 
promise of the Father, the baptism in the Holy Spirit and fi  re, according to the com-
mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the

[19] mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the 
bestowment of the gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry (Luke 24:49; Acts 
1:4,8; 1 Corinthians 12:1–31). This experience is distinct from and subsequent to the 
experience of the new birth (Acts 8:12–17; 10:44–46; 11:14–16; 15:7–9). With the bap-
tism in the Holy Spirit come such experiences as an overfl  owing fullness of the Spirit 
(John 7:37–39; Acts 4:8), a deepened reverence for God (Acts 2:43; Hebrews 12:28), an 
intensifi ed consecration to God and dedication to His work (Acts 2:42), and a more 
active love for Christ, for His Word, and for the lost (Mark 16:20).
8. THE INITIAL PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT

sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts

[20] The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical 
sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts 
2:4). The speaking in tongues in this instance is the same in essence as the gift of 
tongues (1 Corinthians 12:4–10,28), but different in purpose and use.

11. THE MINISTRY
A divinely called and scripturally ordained ministry has been provided by our Lord 
for the fourfold purpose of leading the Church in: (1) evangelization of the world (Mark 
16:15–20), (2) worship of God (John 4:23,24), (3) building a Body of saints being per-
fected in the image of His Son (Ephesians 4:11,16), and (4) meeting human need with 
ministries of love and compassion (Psalm 112:9; Galatians 2:10; 6:10; James 1:27).
12. DIVINE HEALING
Divine healing is an integral part of the gospel. Deliverance from sickness is pro-
vided for in the Atonement, and is the privilege of all believers (Isaiah 53:4,5; Mat-
thew 8:16,17; James 5:14–16).
13. THE BLESSED HOPE
The resurrection of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and their translation 
together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).

[22] together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).
14. THE MILLENNIAL REIGN OF CHRIST
The second coming of Christ includes the rapture of the saints, which is our 
blessed hope, followed by the visible return of Christ with His saints to reign on 
the earth for one thousand years (Zechariah 14:5; Matthew 24:27,30; Revelation 1:7; 
19:11–14; 20:1–6). This millennial reign will bring the salvation of national Israel (Eze-
kiel 37:21,22; Zephaniah 3:19,20; Romans 11:26,27) and the establishment of univer-
sal peace (Isaiah 11:6–9; Psalm 72:3–8; Micah 4:3,4).
15. THE FINAL JUDGMENT
There will be a fi  nal judgment in which the wicked dead will be raised and judged 
according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to

[23] according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to 
everlasting punishment in the lake which burneth with fi  re and brimstone, which is 
the second death (Matthew 25:46; Mark 9:43–48; Revelation 19:20; 20:11–15; 21:8).
16. THE NEW HEAVENS AND THE NEW EARTH
“We, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein 
dwelleth righteousness” (2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 21,22).
Scripture quotations are from the King James Version of the Holy Bible.

Romans 13:7 argues to offer the state worship.  While Christians generally obey and 
submit to earthly authorities, earthly authorities are not absolutes. All submission occurs 
under the umbrella of Christian allegiance to God. His Person and kingdom cannot be 
compared with or subjected to any earthly power. 
 
Witness as Our Core Mission 
For the New Testament writers, being witnesses of God’s reconciling work in Christ is a 
core responsibility of believers . Anything that interferes with this work opposes the 
Christian faith, no matter the motivation. Acting in the name of Christ while  undermining 
the gospel’s presentation and the Church’s mission risks disobedience to Christ (Matthew 
28:19–20). Let it not be said of us that people blaspheme the name of God because of 
us (Romans 2:24). 
 
Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present

Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present  
simplistic answers that create us -vs-them scenarios . Desiring to make a positive 
difference in the world, well-meaning Christians often choose a side and universally adopt 
its stance on all the issues. In so doing, they can alienate others and damage their ability 
to witness to them. In a worst-case scenario, a chosen side might reveal itself as opposing 
Christian faith and virtue.  Christians must be careful in participating in any potentially 
harmful system that does not accurately represent Christ or His kingdom. 
 
Christians should ensure that their civic engagements are in harmony with their core 
task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere .

[28] task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere . 
Believers should take moral stands on issues that matter to God. However, they should 
exercise caution and discernment in how they do so, living as wise agents of Christ ’s 
kingdom. 
 
Salt and Light 
One of Jesus’ best-known teachings contains dual metaphors for Christian engagement 
with the world. “You are the salt of the earth,” He said, and “You are the light of the world” 
(Matthew 5:13–14). In the right measure, salt improves what it touches. Similarly, 
Christians improve their environment. Consider this  test for valid Christian engagement: 
Does our influence make our environment better or worse? 
 
Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in

[29] Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in 
heaven” (Matthew 5:16). Jesus expects His followers to radiate goodness that dispels the 
darkness of evil . The light of their  good works point s to the Father —the Source of 
goodness. It elicits genuine praise for God from those who observe these acts of light . 
Consider another key test  for Christian engagement: Are people drawn to God by our 
public actions and disposition, or are they turned off?

[30] 6 
Love of God and Others 
Jesus was asked, “Of all the commandments, which is the most important?” (Mark 12:28). 
He offered a simple and comprehensive answer: Love God with all your being and love 
others as if they were you. Love is not an add-on; the characteristic of love defines those 
living an authentically Christian faith (John 13:35). 
 
First Corinthians 13 provides the best description of love in the Christian community. This 
list of love ’s characteristics mirrors actions in  every sphere of life, including public li fe. 
Biblical love raises another question: How does our participation in politics and other civic 
duties reflect the criteria of love, regardless of our intentions?  
 
The Role of the Holy Spirit  
All Christians should seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance when engaging in civic and political 
matters. Every aspect of Christian life depends on the Holy Spirit. As in the life of Jesus,

[31] All Christians should seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance when engaging in civic and political 
matters. Every aspect of Christian life depends on the Holy Spirit. As in the life of Jesus, 
the Holy Spirit must play a central role in guiding, facilitating, and empowering believers’ 
private and public lives. Christians engaged in the work of citizenship on their own risk 
the peril faced by the Galatians. They attempted to complete God’s work in the energy of 
the flesh (Galatians 3:3). We must also resist the urge to misuse a spiritual gift to earn  
political approval . To do so would make one no better than the court prophets  of 
Jeremiah’s day , who only prophesied in favor of the king. Are we living  as citizens  
according to the Spirit’s fruit and gifts (Galatians 5:22–23; 1 Corinthians 12, etc.)?

Conclusion 
 
Scripture does not single out one detailed model for Christian participation in civic and 
political spheres. As “the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and conduct,”
5 the Bible does 
offer powerful truths that should guide Christians ’ civic and political lives. T hroughout 
history, Christians have responded as best they could, in different political circumstances, 
as they sought to be faithful  to the Bible  in their unique contexts. From this important 
discussion comes the following summation for careful consideration. 
 
Believers must be mindful of their core identity as people of another kingdom. Allegiance 
to Christ as the only Lord and the defining role as His witnesses is crucial. As Christians 
act in love and as salt and light, under the guiding power of the Holy Spirit, they lead 
others to God, proclaim the gospel, and improve the world around them.

Modern political movements are not centered around God’s destiny for humanity but 
rather focus on their ends. Further, they achieve those ends through power plays that 
rely on the successful domination of others rather than cooperation with the Holy Spirit. 
 
In practical terms, as followers of Christ and ministers of the gospel, we should:

9. SANCTIFICATION
Sanctifi cation is an act of separation from that which is evil, and of dedication 
unto God (Romans 12:1,2; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; Hebrews 13:12). Scriptures teach a 
life of “holiness without which no man shall see the Lord” (Hebrews 12:14). By the 
power of the Holy Spirit we are able to obey the command: “Be ye holy, for I am holy” 
(1 Peter 1:15,16).
Sanctifi cation is realized in the believer by recognizing his identifi  cation with 
Christ in His death and resurrection, and by faith reckoning daily upon the fact of that 
union, and by offering every faculty continually to the dominion of the Holy Spirit 
(Romans 6:1–11,13; 8:1,2,13; Galatians 2:20; Philippians 2:12,13; 1 Peter 1:5).

divine appointments for the fulfi  llment of her Great Commission. Each believer, born

he Bible is our all–suffi  cient rule for faith and practice. This Statement of Fun-
damental Truths is intended simply as a basis of fellowship among us (i.e., that 
we all speak the same thing, 1 Corinthians 1:10; Acts 2:42). The phraseology 
employed in this statement is not inspired or contended for, but the truth set forth 
is held to be essential to a full–gospel ministry. No claim is made that it contains all 
biblical truth, only that it covers our need as to these fundamental doctrines.
1. THE SCRIPTURES INSPIRED
The Scriptures, both the Old and New Testaments, are verbally inspired of God 
and are the revelation of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and 
conduct (2 Timothy 3:15–17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Peter 1:21).
2. THE ONE TRUE GOD
The one true God has revealed himself as the eternally self–existent “I AM,” the 
Creator of heaven and earth and the Redeemer of mankind. He has further revealed

[3] a. His virgin birth (Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:31,35). 
b. His sinless life (Hebrews 7:26; 1 Peter 2:22).
c. His miracles (Acts 2:22; 10:38).
d. His substitutionary work on the cross (1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
e. His bodily resurrection from the dead (Matthew 28:6; Luke 24:39; 1 Corinthians 
15:4).
f. His exaltation to the right hand of God (Acts 1:9,11; 2:33; Philippians 2:9–11; 
Hebrews 1:3).
4. THE FALL OF MAN
Man was created good and upright; for God said, “Let us make man in our 
image, after our likeness.” However, man by voluntary transgression fell and thereby 
incurred not only physical death but also spiritual death, which is separation from 
God (Genesis 1:26,27; 2:17; 3:6; Romans 5:12–19).
5. THE SALVATION OF MAN
Man’s only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son 
of God.

[13] gifts, and healing without the universality of Spirit baptism 
and tongues. There is a real danger, in the words of Earl Creps, 
of a generation of Assemblies of God “post-Pentecostal Pen-
tecostals” that affi  rm the Statement of Fundamental Truths 
and enjoy relationships, but do not seek to practice or pro-
mote Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues.
General Superintendent Wood disputes this pessimistic 
picture in a 2014 centennial interview in Charisma magazine. 
His observations, interviews with leaders, and wide travel 
affi rm that Spirit baptism with the initial physical evidence of 
tongues is alive and growing. He affi  rmed that the statistics 
are imperfect, not refl  ecting practices in thousands of churches in recent years.

notes a signifi cant rise in Pentecostal practices, even among those not tradition-
ally labeled Pentecostal or charismatic. For much the evangelical world in particular,

[14] notes a signifi cant rise in Pentecostal practices, even among those not tradition-
ally labeled Pentecostal or charismatic. For much the evangelical world in particular, 
praying for healing and miracles, exercising spiritual gifts, trusting the Lord for deliv-
erance, and speaking in tongues are all valid biblical practices. This is a signifi  cant 
change within one generation. 
Cessationism (the belief that the manifestations of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians 
12–14 ceased with the death of the original apostles or the close of the New Testa-
ment canon in the fourth century) is a declining movement as believers of all denom-
inations and theological persuasions affi  rm the contemporary work of the Spirit. 
Though many of these groups do not share the “classical” Pentecostal distinctive 
of tongues as the initial physical evident of Spirit baptism, the affi  rmation that the 
Spirit works in and through all the gifts is a heartening change.

[15] of tongues as the initial physical evident of Spirit baptism, the affi  rmation that the

There are some signs across the United States that cause concern among 
thoughtful persons. The number of people that answered “none” when asked for reli-
gious affi  liation has grown from a miniscule percentage in the 1980s to 16.1  per-
cent in a 2007 poll by Pew Research. And 28 percent have left the faith they were 
raised in or affi  liate with no religion at all.
1 This refl  ects two trends: (1) the loss of 
denominational loyalty among some that might still (vaguely) identify themselves as 
Christians; and (2) an increasing number of the U.S. population (both immigrant and 
native-born) with no religious affi liation.

[16] “Post-Christian” and “postmodern” are labels tossed about with great frequency 
in popular analysis. The United States remains much more religious than most of 
Western Europe; however, “being spiritual and not religious” is gaining as a category 
of a generation without signifi  cant exposure to the gospel. 
The new challenge for Assemblies of God leaders is evangelization of people with 
no Christian memory. This is a new phenomenon for many U.S. leaders (though not 
for the appointed missionaries of AGWM). 
Another concern among thoughtful adherents is moral compromise with the 
subversion of traditional marriage and sexuality in the last half-century. The public

consensus in the West and the United States of lifelong heterosexual marriage and 
celibacy for singles is no longer the prevailing opinion of popular culture or even 
a majority of people. While strong elements within American society advocate or 
support gay marriage, the Assemblies of God stands fi  rmly committed to scriptural 
teaching that marriage is between a man and a woman.
When confronted by actual or potential compromise in other evangelical or Pen-
tecostal fellowships and organizations, steadfast adherence to biblical marriage is 
quickly affi  rmed. The Assemblies of God leadership has been uncompromising it its 
standards of sexual conduct while affi  rming love for all people broken by sin.

[18] OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD!
The evangelical revivals of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries fueled the 
birth of global missions. The Pentecostal awakenings have accelerated the spread 
of the gospel in the twentieth century. We are now witnesses the re-evangelizing of 
Europe and the United States by missional believers from developing nations. The 
gospel is now going from everywhere to everywhere as former missions fi elds become 
missions-sending agencies. 
When Melvin Hodges penned The Indigenous Church in 1953, the aim of missions was 
a self-sustaining local church and, in the long-term, a self-sustaining national fellow-
ship. These remain important goals; however, a more complete goal is emerging in the 
twenty-fi rst century: establishing churches and fellowships of churches that become 
not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around

[19] not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around 
the world answer the Great Commission call and become “360  Churches.” Mission-
ary-scholars such as Alan Johnson in Thailand are now articulating an integration of 
apostolic pioneering and church planting united with holistic care for communities. 
In the post-Christian West, Pentecostal spirituality and theology are the answer 
for generations that are hungry for experience and meaning rooted in love and truth. 
Apologetics and careful explanations of truth must be united with the proclamation 
of the Cross and power of the Spirit to deliver, heal, forgive, redeem, and transform. 
Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The 
signs and wonders demonstrated in Scripture are alive and well on the frontiers of

[20] Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The 
signs and wonders demonstrated in Scripture are alive and well on the frontiers of 
evangelization and missions today. The Assemblies of God has a bright future as we 
recognize those frontiers across the street and around the world.
Gary McGee’s fi nal work, Miracles, Missions and American Pentecostalism (2010), details 
the supernatural confi rmation of the missionary pioneers. As a new Spirit-empowered 
generation hears the call to evangelism, worship, discipleship, and compassion, they 
can expect the Lord of the harvest to again confi  rm the message of grace.

relationship, as to its mode is inscrutable and incomprehensible, because unexplained 
(Luke 1:35; 1 Corinthians 1:24; Matthew 11:25–27; 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14; 1 John 1:3,4).
(c) Unity of the One Being of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
Accordingly, therefore, there is that in the Father which constitutes Him the Father 
and not the Son; there is that in the Son which constitutes Him the Son and not the 
Father; and there is that in the Holy Spirit which constitutes Him the Holy Spirit and 
not either the Father or the Son. Wherefore, the Father is the Begetter; the Son is the 
Begotten; and the Holy Spirit is the One proceeding from the Father and the Son. There-
fore, because these three persons in the godhead are in a state of unity, there is but 
one Lord God Almighty and His name one (John 1:18; 15:26; 17:11,21; Zechariah 14:9).
(d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor

[22] (d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor 
confused as to relation; nor divided in respect to the godhead; nor opposed as to 
cooperation. The Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son as to relationship. 
The Son is with the Father and the Father is with the Son, as to fellowship. The Father 
is not from the Son, but the Son is from the Father, as to authority. The Holy Spirit 
is from the Father and the Son proceeding, as to nature, relationship, cooperation, 
and authority. Hence, no person in the godhead either exists or works separately or 
independently of the others (John 5:17–30,32,37; 8:17,18).
(e) The Title, Lord Jesus Christ
The appellation Lord Jesus Christ, is a proper name. It is never applied in the New 
Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us

[23] Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us
The Lord Jesus Christ, as to His divine and eternal nature, is the proper and only 
Begotten of the Father, but as to His human nature, He is the proper Son of Man. He 
is, therefore, acknowledged to be both God and man; who because He is God and 
man, is “Immanuel,” God with us (Matthew 1:23; 1 John 4:2,10,14; Revelation 1:13,17).
(g) The Title, Son of God
Since the name Immanuel embraces both God and man, in the one person, our 
Lord Jesus Christ, it follows that the title Son of God describes His proper deity, and 
the title Son of Man, His proper humanity. Therefore, the title Son of God belongs to 
the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23; 
2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).
(h) Transgression of the Doctrine of Christ

[24] the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23; 
2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).
(h) Transgression of the Doctrine of Christ
Wherefore, it is a transgression of the doctrine of Christ to say that Jesus Christ 
derived the title Son of God solely from the fact of the Incarnation, or because of His 
relation to the economy of redemption. Therefore, to deny that the Father is a real 
and eternal Father, and that the Son is a real and eternal Son, is a denial of the

a. Conditions to Salvation
Salvation is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord 
Jesus Christ. By the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, being 
justifi ed by grace through faith, man becomes an heir of God according to the hope of 
eternal life (Luke 24:47; John 3:3; Romans 10:13–15; Ephesians 2:8; Titus 2:11; 3:5–7).
b. The Evidences of Salvation
The inward evidence of salvation is the direct witness of the Spirit (Romans 8:16). 
The outward evidence to all men is a life of righteousness and true holiness (Ephe-
sians 4:24; Titus 2:12).
 6. THE ORDINANCES OF THE CHURCH
a. Baptism in Water
The ordinance of baptism by immersion is commanded in the Scriptures. All who 
repent and believe on Christ as Savior and Lord are to be baptized. Thus they declare 
to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with

[26] repent and believe on Christ as Savior and Lord are to be baptized. Thus they declare 
to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with 
Him to walk in newness of life (Matthew 28:19; Mark 16:16; Acts 10:47,48; Romans 6:4).
b. Holy Communion
The Lord’s Supper, consisting of the elements—bread and the fruit of the vine—is 
the symbol expressing our sharing the divine nature of our Lord Jesus Christ (2 Peter 
1:4); a memorial of His suffering and death (1 Corinthians 11:26); and a prophecy of His 
second coming (1 Corinthians 11:26); and is enjoined on all believers “till He come!”
7. THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
All believers are entitled to and should ardently expect and earnestly seek the 
promise of the Father, the baptism in the Holy Spirit and fi  re, according to the com-
mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the

[27] mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the 
bestowment of the gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry (Luke 24:49; Acts 
1:4,8; 1 Corinthians 12:1–31). This experience is distinct from and subsequent to the 
experience of the new birth (Acts 8:12–17; 10:44–46; 11:14–16; 15:7–9). With the bap-
tism in the Holy Spirit come such experiences as an overfl  owing fullness of the Spirit 
(John 7:37–39; Acts 4:8), a deepened reverence for God (Acts 2:43; Hebrews 12:28), an 
intensifi ed consecration to God and dedication to His work (Acts 2:42), and a more 
active love for Christ, for His Word, and for the lost (Mark 16:20).
8. THE INITIAL PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical 
sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts

[28] The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical 
sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts 
2:4). The speaking in tongues in this instance is the same in essence as the gift of 
tongues (1 Corinthians 12:4–10,28), but different in purpose and use.

11. THE MINISTRY
A divinely called and scripturally ordained ministry has been provided by our Lord 
for the fourfold purpose of leading the Church in: (1) evangelization of the world (Mark 
16:15–20), (2) worship of God (John 4:23,24), (3) building a Body of saints being per-
fected in the image of His Son (Ephesians 4:11,16), and (4) meeting human need with 
ministries of love and compassion (Psalm 112:9; Galatians 2:10; 6:10; James 1:27).
12. DIVINE HEALING
Divine healing is an integral part of the gospel. Deliverance from sickness is pro-
vided for in the Atonement, and is the privilege of all believers (Isaiah 53:4,5; Mat-
thew 8:16,17; James 5:14–16).
13. THE BLESSED HOPE
The resurrection of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and their translation 
together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).

[30] together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).
14. THE MILLENNIAL REIGN OF CHRIST
The second coming of Christ includes the rapture of the saints, which is our 
blessed hope, followed by the visible return of Christ with His saints to reign on 
the earth for one thousand years (Zechariah 14:5; Matthew 24:27,30; Revelation 1:7; 
19:11–14; 20:1–6). This millennial reign will bring the salvation of national Israel (Eze-
kiel 37:21,22; Zephaniah 3:19,20; Romans 11:26,27) and the establishment of univer-
sal peace (Isaiah 11:6–9; Psalm 72:3–8; Micah 4:3,4).
15. THE FINAL JUDGMENT
There will be a fi  nal judgment in which the wicked dead will be raised and judged 
according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to

[31] according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to 
everlasting punishment in the lake which burneth with fi  re and brimstone, which is 
the second death (Matthew 25:46; Mark 9:43–48; Revelation 19:20; 20:11–15; 21:8).
16. THE NEW HEAVENS AND THE NEW EARTH
“We, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein 
dwelleth righteousness” (2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 21,22).
Scripture quotations are from the King James Version of the Holy Bible.

9. SANCTIFICATION
Sanctifi cation is an act of separation from that which is evil, and of dedication 
unto God (Romans 12:1,2; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; Hebrews 13:12). Scriptures teach a 
life of “holiness without which no man shall see the Lord” (Hebrews 12:14). By the 
power of the Holy Spirit we are able to obey the command: “Be ye holy, for I am holy” 
(1 Peter 1:15,16).
Sanctifi cation is realized in the believer by recognizing his identifi  cation with 
Christ in His death and resurrection, and by faith reckoning daily upon the fact of that 
union, and by offering every faculty continually to the dominion of the Holy Spirit 
(Romans 6:1–11,13; 8:1,2,13; Galatians 2:20; Philippians 2:12,13; 1 Peter 1:5).

T
he Bible is our all–suffi  cient rule for faith and practice. This Statement of Fun-
damental Truths is intended simply as a basis of fellowship among us (i.e., that 
we all speak the same thing, 1 Corinthians 1:10; Acts 2:42). The phraseology 
employed in this statement is not inspired or contended for, but the truth set forth 
is held to be essential to a full–gospel ministry. No claim is made that it contains all 
biblical truth, only that it covers our need as to these fundamental doctrines.
1. THE SCRIPTURES INSPIRED
The Scriptures, both the Old and New Testaments, are verbally inspired of God 
and are the revelation of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and 
conduct (2 Timothy 3:15–17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Peter 1:21).
2. THE ONE TRUE GOD
The one true God has revealed himself as the eternally self–existent “I AM,” the 
Creator of heaven and earth and the Redeemer of mankind. He has further revealed

[3] a. His virgin birth (Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:31,35). 
b. His sinless life (Hebrews 7:26; 1 Peter 2:22).
c. His miracles (Acts 2:22; 10:38).
d. His substitutionary work on the cross (1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
e. His bodily resurrection from the dead (Matthew 28:6; Luke 24:39; 1 Corinthians 
15:4).
f. His exaltation to the right hand of God (Acts 1:9,11; 2:33; Philippians 2:9–11; 
Hebrews 1:3).
4. THE FALL OF MAN
Man was created good and upright; for God said, “Let us make man in our 
image, after our likeness.” However, man by voluntary transgression fell and thereby 
incurred not only physical death but also spiritual death, which is separation from 
God (Genesis 1:26,27; 2:17; 3:6; Romans 5:12–19).
5. THE SALVATION OF MAN
Man’s only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son 
of God.

10. avoid any nationalism or identity politics that elevates political identities and 
obscures a primary allegiance to Christ. Such conduct is divisive, potentially 
idolatrous, and leads away from the Assemblies of God’ s mission to evangelize 
the lost, worship God, disciple believers, and show compassion,  as expressed in 
Articles 10 and 11 of the Statement of Fundamental Truths. 
 
6 “10 Guidelines for Christian Voters,” Pentecostal Evangel, October 14, 1984, 13. Full text: “1. Do not confuse patriotism, national 
pride, and Western culture with Christian faith and practice. 2. Do not confuse secular political activity with the purpose of the church 
nor campaigning with witnessing and preaching. 3. Do not make slanderous or false accusations against your opponents but 
maintain your integrity. Do not consider a brother or sister who is of like precious faith an adversary if he or she holds a different

Romans 13:7 argues to offer the state worship.  While Christians generally obey and 
submit to earthly authorities, earthly authorities are not absolutes. All submission occurs 
under the umbrella of Christian allegiance to God. His Person and kingdom cannot be 
compared with or subjected to any earthly power. 
 
Witness as Our Core Mission 
For the New Testament writers, being witnesses of God’s reconciling work in Christ is a 
core responsibility of believers . Anything that interferes with this work opposes the 
Christian faith, no matter the motivation. Acting in the name of Christ while  undermining 
the gospel’s presentation and the Church’s mission risks disobedience to Christ (Matthew 
28:19–20). Let it not be said of us that people blaspheme the name of God because of 
us (Romans 2:24). 
 
Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present

Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present  
simplistic answers that create us -vs-them scenarios . Desiring to make a positive 
difference in the world, well-meaning Christians often choose a side and universally adopt 
its stance on all the issues. In so doing, they can alienate others and damage their ability 
to witness to them. In a worst-case scenario, a chosen side might reveal itself as opposing 
Christian faith and virtue.  Christians must be careful in participating in any potentially 
harmful system that does not accurately represent Christ or His kingdom. 
 
Christians should ensure that their civic engagements are in harmony with their core 
task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere .

[7] task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere . 
Believers should take moral stands on issues that matter to God. However, they should 
exercise caution and discernment in how they do so, living as wise agents of Christ ’s 
kingdom. 
 
Salt and Light 
One of Jesus’ best-known teachings contains dual metaphors for Christian engagement 
with the world. “You are the salt of the earth,” He said, and “You are the light of the world” 
(Matthew 5:13–14). In the right measure, salt improves what it touches. Similarly, 
Christians improve their environment. Consider this  test for valid Christian engagement: 
Does our influence make our environment better or worse? 
 
Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in

[8] Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in 
heaven” (Matthew 5:16). Jesus expects His followers to radiate goodness that dispels the 
darkness of evil . The light of their  good works point s to the Father —the Source of 
goodness. It elicits genuine praise for God from those who observe these acts of light . 
Consider another key test  for Christian engagement: Are people drawn to God by our 
public actions and disposition, or are they turned off?

[9] 6 
Love of God and Others 
Jesus was asked, “Of all the commandments, which is the most important?” (Mark 12:28). 
He offered a simple and comprehensive answer: Love God with all your being and love 
others as if they were you. Love is not an add-on; the characteristic of love defines those 
living an authentically Christian faith (John 13:35). 
 
First Corinthians 13 provides the best description of love in the Christian community. This 
list of love ’s characteristics mirrors actions in  every sphere of life, including public li fe. 
Biblical love raises another question: How does our participation in politics and other civic 
duties reflect the criteria of love, regardless of our intentions?  
 
The Role of the Holy Spirit  
All Christians should seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance when engaging in civic and political 
matters. Every aspect of Christian life depends on the Holy Spirit. As in the life of Jesus,

[10] All Christians should seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance when engaging in civic and political 
matters. Every aspect of Christian life depends on the Holy Spirit. As in the life of Jesus, 
the Holy Spirit must play a central role in guiding, facilitating, and empowering believers’ 
private and public lives. Christians engaged in the work of citizenship on their own risk 
the peril faced by the Galatians. They attempted to complete God’s work in the energy of 
the flesh (Galatians 3:3). We must also resist the urge to misuse a spiritual gift to earn  
political approval . To do so would make one no better than the court prophets  of 
Jeremiah’s day , who only prophesied in favor of the king. Are we living  as citizens  
according to the Spirit’s fruit and gifts (Galatians 5:22–23; 1 Corinthians 12, etc.)? 
 
Conclusion 
 
Scripture does not single out one detailed model for Christian participation in civic and

[11] according to the Spirit’s fruit and gifts (Galatians 5:22–23; 1 Corinthians 12, etc.)? 
 
Conclusion 
 
Scripture does not single out one detailed model for Christian participation in civic and 
political spheres. As “the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and conduct,”
5 the Bible does 
offer powerful truths that should guide Christians ’ civic and political lives. T hroughout 
history, Christians have responded as best they could, in different political circumstances, 
as they sought to be faithful  to the Bible  in their unique contexts. From this important 
discussion comes the following summation for careful consideration. 
 
Believers must be mindful of their core identity as people of another kingdom. Allegiance 
to Christ as the only Lord and the defining role as His witnesses is crucial. As Christians 
act in love and as salt and light, under the guiding power of the Holy Spirit, they lead 
others to God, proclaim the gospel, and improve the world around them.

[12] act in love and as salt and light, under the guiding power of the Holy Spirit, they lead 
others to God, proclaim the gospel, and improve the world around them. 
 
Modern political movements are not centered around God’s destiny for humanity but 
rather focus on their ends. Further, they achieve those ends through power plays that 
rely on the successful domination of others rather than cooperation with the Holy Spirit. 
 
In practical terms, as followers of Christ and ministers of the gospel, we should:  
 
1. prioritize the gospel and its propagation far above personal and political 
allegiances;

of a generation of Assemblies of God “post-Pentecostal Pen-

and enjoy relationships, but do not seek to practice or pro-
mote Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues.

His observations, interviews with leaders, and wide travel

[14] notes a signifi cant rise in Pentecostal practices, even among those not tradition-
ally labeled Pentecostal or charismatic. For much the evangelical world in particular, 
praying for healing and miracles, exercising spiritual gifts, trusting the Lord for deliv-
erance, and speaking in tongues are all valid biblical practices. This is a signifi  cant 
change within one generation. 
Cessationism (the belief that the manifestations of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians 
12–14 ceased with the death of the original apostles or the close of the New Testa-
ment canon in the fourth century) is a declining movement as believers of all denom-
inations and theological persuasions affi  rm the contemporary work of the Spirit. 
Though many of these groups do not share the “classical” Pentecostal distinctive

gious affi  liation has grown from a miniscule percentage in the 1980s to 16.1  per-
cent in a 2007 poll by Pew Research. And 28 percent have left the faith they were 
raised in or affi  liate with no religion at all.
1 This refl  ects two trends: (1) the loss of 
denominational loyalty among some that might still (vaguely) identify themselves as 
Christians; and (2) an increasing number of the U.S. population (both immigrant and 
native-born) with no religious affi liation.

[16] “Post-Christian” and “postmodern” are labels tossed about with great frequency 
in popular analysis. The United States remains much more religious than most of 
Western Europe; however, “being spiritual and not religious” is gaining as a category 
of a generation without signifi  cant exposure to the gospel. 
The new challenge for Assemblies of God leaders is evangelization of people with 
no Christian memory. This is a new phenomenon for many U.S. leaders (though not 
for the appointed missionaries of AGWM). 
Another concern among thoughtful adherents is moral compromise with the 
subversion of traditional marriage and sexuality in the last half-century. The public

consensus in the West and the United States of lifelong heterosexual marriage and 
celibacy for singles is no longer the prevailing opinion of popular culture or even 
a majority of people. While strong elements within American society advocate or 
support gay marriage, the Assemblies of God stands fi  rmly committed to scriptural 
teaching that marriage is between a man and a woman.
When confronted by actual or potential compromise in other evangelical or Pen-
tecostal fellowships and organizations, steadfast adherence to biblical marriage is 
quickly affi  rmed. The Assemblies of God leadership has been uncompromising it its 
standards of sexual conduct while affi  rming love for all people broken by sin.

[18] OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD!
The evangelical revivals of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries fueled the 
birth of global missions. The Pentecostal awakenings have accelerated the spread 
of the gospel in the twentieth century. We are now witnesses the re-evangelizing of 
Europe and the United States by missional believers from developing nations. The 
gospel is now going from everywhere to everywhere as former missions fi elds become 
missions-sending agencies. 
When Melvin Hodges penned The Indigenous Church in 1953, the aim of missions was 
a self-sustaining local church and, in the long-term, a self-sustaining national fellow-
ship. These remain important goals; however, a more complete goal is emerging in the 
twenty-fi rst century: establishing churches and fellowships of churches that become 
not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around

[19] not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around 
the world answer the Great Commission call and become “360  Churches.” Mission-
ary-scholars such as Alan Johnson in Thailand are now articulating an integration of 
apostolic pioneering and church planting united with holistic care for communities. 
In the post-Christian West, Pentecostal spirituality and theology are the answer 
for generations that are hungry for experience and meaning rooted in love and truth. 
Apologetics and careful explanations of truth must be united with the proclamation 
of the Cross and power of the Spirit to deliver, heal, forgive, redeem, and transform. 
Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The

[20] Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The 
signs and wonders demonstrated in Scripture are alive and well on the frontiers of 
evangelization and missions today. The Assemblies of God has a bright future as we 
recognize those frontiers across the street and around the world.
Gary McGee’s fi nal work, Miracles, Missions and American Pentecostalism (2010), details 
the supernatural confi rmation of the missionary pioneers. As a new Spirit-empowered 
generation hears the call to evangelism, worship, discipleship, and compassion, they 
can expect the Lord of the harvest to again confi  rm the message of grace.

relationship, as to its mode is inscrutable and incomprehensible, because unexplained 
(Luke 1:35; 1 Corinthians 1:24; Matthew 11:25–27; 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14; 1 John 1:3,4).
(c) Unity of the One Being of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
Accordingly, therefore, there is that in the Father which constitutes Him the Father 
and not the Son; there is that in the Son which constitutes Him the Son and not the 
Father; and there is that in the Holy Spirit which constitutes Him the Holy Spirit and 
not either the Father or the Son. Wherefore, the Father is the Begetter; the Son is the 
Begotten; and the Holy Spirit is the One proceeding from the Father and the Son. There-
fore, because these three persons in the godhead are in a state of unity, there is but 
one Lord God Almighty and His name one (John 1:18; 15:26; 17:11,21; Zechariah 14:9).
(d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor

[22] (d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor 
confused as to relation; nor divided in respect to the godhead; nor opposed as to 
cooperation. The Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son as to relationship. 
The Son is with the Father and the Father is with the Son, as to fellowship. The Father 
is not from the Son, but the Son is from the Father, as to authority. The Holy Spirit 
is from the Father and the Son proceeding, as to nature, relationship, cooperation, 
and authority. Hence, no person in the godhead either exists or works separately or 
independently of the others (John 5:17–30,32,37; 8:17,18).
(e) The Title, Lord Jesus Christ
The appellation Lord Jesus Christ, is a proper name. It is never applied in the New 
Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us

[23] Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us
The Lord Jesus Christ, as to His divine and eternal nature, is the proper and only 
Begotten of the Father, but as to His human nature, He is the proper Son of Man. He 
is, therefore, acknowledged to be both God and man; who because He is God and 
man, is “Immanuel,” God with us (Matthew 1:23; 1 John 4:2,10,14; Revelation 1:13,17).
(g) The Title, Son of God
Since the name Immanuel embraces both God and man, in the one person, our 
Lord Jesus Christ, it follows that the title Son of God describes His proper deity, and 
the title Son of Man, His proper humanity. Therefore, the title Son of God belongs to 
the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23; 
2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).

[24] the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23; 
2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).
(h) Transgression of the Doctrine of Christ
Wherefore, it is a transgression of the doctrine of Christ to say that Jesus Christ 
derived the title Son of God solely from the fact of the Incarnation, or because of His 
relation to the economy of redemption. Therefore, to deny that the Father is a real 
and eternal Father, and that the Son is a real and eternal Son, is a denial of the

a. Conditions to Salvation
Salvation is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord 
Jesus Christ. By the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, being 
justifi ed by grace through faith, man becomes an heir of God according to the hope of 
eternal life (Luke 24:47; John 3:3; Romans 10:13–15; Ephesians 2:8; Titus 2:11; 3:5–7).
b. The Evidences of Salvation
The inward evidence of salvation is the direct witness of the Spirit (Romans 8:16). 
The outward evidence to all men is a life of righteousness and true holiness (Ephe-
sians 4:24; Titus 2:12).
 6. THE ORDINANCES OF THE CHURCH
a. Baptism in Water
The ordinance of baptism by immersion is commanded in the Scriptures. All who 
repent and believe on Christ as Savior and Lord are to be baptized. Thus they declare 
to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with

[26] repent and believe on Christ as Savior and Lord are to be baptized. Thus they declare 
to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with 
Him to walk in newness of life (Matthew 28:19; Mark 16:16; Acts 10:47,48; Romans 6:4).
b. Holy Communion
The Lord’s Supper, consisting of the elements—bread and the fruit of the vine—is 
the symbol expressing our sharing the divine nature of our Lord Jesus Christ (2 Peter 
1:4); a memorial of His suffering and death (1 Corinthians 11:26); and a prophecy of His 
second coming (1 Corinthians 11:26); and is enjoined on all believers “till He come!”
7. THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
All believers are entitled to and should ardently expect and earnestly seek the 
promise of the Father, the baptism in the Holy Spirit and fi  re, according to the com-
mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the

[27] mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the 
bestowment of the gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry (Luke 24:49; Acts 
1:4,8; 1 Corinthians 12:1–31). This experience is distinct from and subsequent to the 
experience of the new birth (Acts 8:12–17; 10:44–46; 11:14–16; 15:7–9). With the bap-
tism in the Holy Spirit come such experiences as an overfl  owing fullness of the Spirit 
(John 7:37–39; Acts 4:8), a deepened reverence for God (Acts 2:43; Hebrews 12:28), an 
intensifi ed consecration to God and dedication to His work (Acts 2:42), and a more 
active love for Christ, for His Word, and for the lost (Mark 16:20).
8. THE INITIAL PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical 
sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts

[28] The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical 
sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts 
2:4). The speaking in tongues in this instance is the same in essence as the gift of 
tongues (1 Corinthians 12:4–10,28), but different in purpose and use.

11. THE MINISTRY
A divinely called and scripturally ordained ministry has been provided by our Lord 
for the fourfold purpose of leading the Church in: (1) evangelization of the world (Mark 
16:15–20), (2) worship of God (John 4:23,24), (3) building a Body of saints being per-
fected in the image of His Son (Ephesians 4:11,16), and (4) meeting human need with 
ministries of love and compassion (Psalm 112:9; Galatians 2:10; 6:10; James 1:27).
12. DIVINE HEALING
Divine healing is an integral part of the gospel. Deliverance from sickness is pro-
vided for in the Atonement, and is the privilege of all believers (Isaiah 53:4,5; Mat-
thew 8:16,17; James 5:14–16).
13. THE BLESSED HOPE
The resurrection of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and their translation 
together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).

[30] together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).
14. THE MILLENNIAL REIGN OF CHRIST
The second coming of Christ includes the rapture of the saints, which is our 
blessed hope, followed by the visible return of Christ with His saints to reign on 
the earth for one thousand years (Zechariah 14:5; Matthew 24:27,30; Revelation 1:7; 
19:11–14; 20:1–6). This millennial reign will bring the salvation of national Israel (Eze-
kiel 37:21,22; Zephaniah 3:19,20; Romans 11:26,27) and the establishment of univer-
sal peace (Isaiah 11:6–9; Psalm 72:3–8; Micah 4:3,4).
15. THE FINAL JUDGMENT
There will be a fi  nal judgment in which the wicked dead will be raised and judged 
according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to

[31] according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to 
everlasting punishment in the lake which burneth with fi  re and brimstone, which is 
the second death (Matthew 25:46; Mark 9:43–48; Revelation 19:20; 20:11–15; 21:8).
16. THE NEW HEAVENS AND THE NEW EARTH
“We, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein 
dwelleth righteousness” (2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 21,22).
Scripture quotations are from the King James Version of the Holy Bible.

[1] belief in the existence of the devil, whom they depict as a personal entity. He is described as a serpent in the confrontation with Adam and Eve in Genesis 3. Capable of knowledge, speech, and persuasion, all indicators of a personal entity, he tempted them, and they fell into sin. When Jesus was tempted by the devil, he conversed with Jesus, even using Scriptures, in the effort to divert Jesus from His mission (Matthew 4:1–11; Mark 1:12–13; Luke 4:1–13).  The devil is the adversary, a liar, and a deceiver. His opposition to God, His plan, and His people is fierce and relentless. However, the devil and the demonic forces allied with him are limited. They are not divine and lack the complete knowledge God expresses, they are not able to be present everywhere at the same time, and they are subject to God and His people. They do not have guaranteed access to human thoughts. The believer must be aware of their evil intentions and activities but should not fear them.  When God confronted

[2] to the kingdom of God.  Followers of Christ must remember that the “struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms” (Ephesians 6:12). Jesus summarized the divine expectation for humans: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind” and “Love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:37, 39). From the fall into sin (Genesis 3:1–19), the devil has opposed humanity’s fulfillment of God’s purpose. The perversion, misdirection, and disruption of the intended love for God and neighbor is the opening used by the devil to torment humanity and create the warfare that continues to this day.  The triad—world, flesh, and devil—as a description of the arena in which spiritual warfare takes place is firmly rooted in the biblical tradition. The apostle Paul, in Ephesians 2:1–3, identifies these three as the areas of

[3] the young boy as He returned from the Mount of Transfiguration, He pointed to the necessity of faith and prayer (Matthew 17:20–21; Mark 9:29). In every case, Jesus’ voice was the command that drove demonic forces out of humans.  James provides a powerful means by which the believer can defeat the devil in spiritual warfare: “Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you” (James 4:7). As believers recognize their full dependence on the power of God and that the devil cannot stand before that power, they can refuse to allow the devil any place in their lives. Peter summarizes warfare with the devil by saying, “Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings” (1 Peter 5:8–9).  Pastoral Implications  Spiritual warfare in the world, with the flesh, and

[4] Spiritual Warfare and the Flesh  The New Testament uses flesh (sarx) to describe human nature and flesh, and body (soma) to depict the human body. Often flesh is used to speak of the weaker aspects of human nature, subject to temptation (Matthew 26:41; 2 Peter 2:18). Paul warns against being enslaved by the desires of the flesh (Ephesians 2:3), and challenges believers not to allow their minds to be set on the flesh (Romans 8:5–7).  The warfare with the flesh is with the fallen nature of humankind, which is now directed away from God and His will toward sinful inclinations and desires. In the fall into sin, Adam and Eve yielded to the temptation to have their eyes opened, be like God, and know good and evil (Genesis 3:5). Instead of continuing to recognize God as supreme and allow Him to be the determinant of what is right and wrong, they chose to exalt themselves and to direct their own lives. Such sin caused them to be no longer turned toward God but to be turned inward on

[5] Therefore, John warns, “Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them. For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world” (1 John 2:15–16).  The apostle Paul was aware of spiritual warfare and the world. He challenged the Roman Christians to “not conform to the pattern of this world,” because allowing the world to dominate hinders being able to approve the will of God in each life (Romans 12:2).  The world is the total environment in which humans exist, a world which God created and called good, a world which He loves eternally, but a world that has departed from the plan God had for His creation.  The tragic reality of the record of the fall into sin in Genesis 3 is that the very structural orientation of the world has been altered.

[6] fall into sin in Genesis 3 is that the very structural orientation of the world has been altered. The ease of gaining food from the ground was lost so that thorns and thistles make it difficult to bring food from the soil. Childbirth is with severe pain, and human relationships are radically damaged (Genesis 3:16–19). The welcoming and nurturing world God created became threatening, with human death as the final indignity. Paul describes this disoriented world as “subject to frustration” and “groaning as in the pains of childbirth” awaiting the ultimate victory of God (Romans 8:20–22).  The structure and systems of the fallen world express themselves in opposition to the believer. Governments, governmental agencies, and societal and cultural norms conspire to attack the faith of the Christ-follower. Laws and policies have sometimes been implemented that conflict with the principles revealed by God as His will for humans. Racism in all its forms, ethnic arrogance, and unbridled

[7] Christ-follower. Laws and policies have sometimes been implemented that conflict with the principles revealed by God as His will for humans. Racism in all its forms, ethnic arrogance, and unbridled nationalism coalesce to negate the truths of the Bible.  The constant pressure of the world to mold believers into its image is seen in the multiple ways the world advertises and tempts them to depart from their faith commitment. The steady stream of pictures, images, and marketing appeals, some based on the basest of human instinct, must be met by a commitment to spiritual warfare against these worldly forces.  Spiritual warfare in the world is also experienced in the pressure exerted on believers by fellow world dwellers who are not battling against the negative tug of the world. Instead, they have given over to the world’s forces and place pressure on believers to do likewise. As a warning from biblical history to contemporary Christians, Israel was challenged repeatedly by God about the

[8] have given over to the world’s forces and place pressure on believers to do likewise. As a warning from biblical history to contemporary Christians, Israel was challenged repeatedly by God about the danger of allowing the people of the land of Canaan to lead them away from God to the worship of their gods.  In the warfare between the believer and the evil forces in the world, the resources for victory are spiritual, not political. The apostle John gave the primary challenge for engaging the pressures from the fallen world by saying, “Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them” (1 John 2:15). Supreme love for God, the antithesis of loving the world, is the antidote to the challenges of the world. Jude’s call for believers to build themselves up in the most holy faith and pray in the Holy Spirit (Jude 20) allows the Spirit to pray through them “in accordance with the will of God” (Romans 8:26–27). Such prayer is powerful

[9] build themselves up in the most holy faith and pray in the Holy Spirit (Jude 20) allows the Spirit to pray through them “in accordance with the will of God” (Romans 8:26–27). Such prayer is powerful to bring victory in the spiritual battle in the world.

[10] pray and praise through them in a heavenly language opens the will and purposes of God to strengthen each for the challenges faced in spiritual warfare (Romans 8:26–27; Jude 20).  In the letter to the Ephesians, Paul challenged believers in spiritual warfare “to put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes” (Ephesians 6:11). Spiritual warfare is not against humans; instead, it is with spiritual forces of evil. Standing against such is possible because of the armor provided by God— “the belt of truth . . . the breastplate of righteousness . . . feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace . . . the shield of faith . . . the helmet of salvation . . . the sword of the Spirit” (Ephesians 6:14–17). Paul concluded the presentation of the resources provided the believer for spiritual warfare with a reminder of the power of prayer in the Spirit (Ephesians 6:18).

[11] of the resources provided the believer for spiritual warfare with a reminder of the power of prayer in the Spirit (Ephesians 6:18).  There are some in congregations with emotional and mental challenges which might be helped by medical and counseling professionals. In some instances, the medical profession could be of more assistance than a deliverance ministry. Making use of professional help would not be instead of fervent prayer and intercession. God has the power to heal all of humanity’s illnesses. Great care and dependence on the guidance of the Holy Spirit are needed to determine the best path toward wholeness and healing.  Congregations have the privilege of not only being strengthened to fight personally but also to engage spiritual warfare in a corporate act of intercession. The battle with the world often must be carried on at the systems or structural level. Evil expresses itself through corporate practices, governmental decisions, and cultural traditions. The body of

[12] The battle with the world often must be carried on at the systems or structural level. Evil expresses itself through corporate practices, governmental decisions, and cultural traditions. The body of Christ can see the victory of God through intercessory prayer and actions as needed.  The apostle Paul provided the assurance needed for all believers as they engage in spiritual warfare. “What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? . . . in all things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us” (Romans 8:31–32, 37). Peter, as he begins his second epistle, provided this great assurance: “His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness” (2 Peter 1:3).

They do not have guaranteed access to human thoughts. The believer must be aware of their evil intentions and activities but should not fear them.  When God confronted

[2] to the kingdom of God.  Followers of Christ must remember that the “struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms” (Ephesians 6:12). Jesus summarized the divine expectation for humans: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind” and “Love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:37, 39). From the fall into sin (Genesis 3:1–19), the devil has opposed humanity’s fulfillment of God’s purpose. The perversion, misdirection, and disruption of the intended love for God and neighbor is the opening used by the devil to torment humanity and create the warfare that continues to this day.  The triad—world, flesh, and devil—as a description of the arena in which spiritual warfare takes place is firmly rooted in the biblical tradition. The apostle Paul, in Ephesians 2:1–3, identifies these three as the areas of

[3] the young boy as He returned from the Mount of Transfiguration, He pointed to the necessity of faith and prayer (Matthew 17:20–21; Mark 9:29). In every case, Jesus’ voice was the command that drove demonic forces out of humans.  James provides a powerful means by which the believer can defeat the devil in spiritual warfare: “Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you” (James 4:7). As believers recognize their full dependence on the power of God and that the devil cannot stand before that power, they can refuse to allow the devil any place in their lives. Peter summarizes warfare with the devil by saying, “Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings” (1 Peter 5:8–9).  Pastoral Implications  Spiritual warfare in the world, with the flesh, and

[4] Spiritual Warfare and the Flesh  The New Testament uses flesh (sarx) to describe human nature and flesh, and body (soma) to depict the human body. Often flesh is used to speak of the weaker aspects of human nature, subject to temptation (Matthew 26:41; 2 Peter 2:18). Paul warns against being enslaved by the desires of the flesh (Ephesians 2:3), and challenges believers not to allow their minds to be set on the flesh (Romans 8:5–7).  The warfare with the flesh is with the fallen nature of humankind, which is now directed away from God and His will toward sinful inclinations and desires. In the fall into sin, Adam and Eve yielded to the temptation to have their eyes opened, be like God, and know good and evil (Genesis 3:5). Instead of continuing to recognize God as supreme and allow Him to be the determinant of what is right and wrong, they chose to exalt themselves and to direct their own lives. Such sin caused them to be no longer turned toward God but to be turned inward on

[5] Therefore, John warns, “Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them. For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world” (1 John 2:15–16).  The apostle Paul was aware of spiritual warfare and the world. He challenged the Roman Christians to “not conform to the pattern of this world,” because allowing the world to dominate hinders being able to approve the will of God in each life (Romans 12:2).  The world is the total environment in which humans exist, a world which God created and called good, a world which He loves eternally, but a world that has departed from the plan God had for His creation.  The tragic reality of the record of the fall into sin in Genesis 3 is that the very structural orientation of the world has been altered. The ease of gaining food from the ground was lost so that thorns and thistles make it difficult to

[6] fall into sin in Genesis 3 is that the very structural orientation of the world has been altered. The ease of gaining food from the ground was lost so that thorns and thistles make it difficult to bring food from the soil. Childbirth is with severe pain, and human relationships are radically damaged (Genesis 3:16–19). The welcoming and nurturing world God created became threatening, with human death as the final indignity. Paul describes this disoriented world as “subject to frustration” and “groaning as in the pains of childbirth” awaiting the ultimate victory of God (Romans 8:20–22).  The structure and systems of the fallen world express themselves in opposition to the believer. Governments, governmental agencies, and societal and cultural norms conspire to attack the faith of the Christ-follower. Laws and policies have sometimes been implemented that conflict with the principles revealed by God as His will for humans. Racism in all its forms, ethnic arrogance, and unbridled

[7] Christ-follower. Laws and policies have sometimes been implemented that conflict with the principles revealed by God as His will for humans. Racism in all its forms, ethnic arrogance, and unbridled nationalism coalesce to negate the truths of the Bible.  The constant pressure of the world to mold believers into its image is seen in the multiple ways the world advertises and tempts them to depart from their faith commitment. The steady stream of pictures, images, and marketing appeals, some based on the basest of human instinct, must be met by a commitment to spiritual warfare against these worldly forces.  Spiritual warfare in the world is also experienced in the pressure exerted on believers by fellow world dwellers who are not battling against the negative tug of the world. Instead, they have given over to the world’s forces and place pressure on believers to do likewise. As a warning from biblical history to contemporary Christians, Israel was challenged repeatedly by God about the

[8] have given over to the world’s forces and place pressure on believers to do likewise. As a warning from biblical history to contemporary Christians, Israel was challenged repeatedly by God about the danger of allowing the people of the land of Canaan to lead them away from God to the worship of their gods.  In the warfare between the believer and the evil forces in the world, the resources for victory are spiritual, not political. The apostle John gave the primary challenge for engaging the pressures from the fallen world by saying, “Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them” (1 John 2:15). Supreme love for God, the antithesis of loving the world, is the antidote to the challenges of the world. Jude’s call for believers to build themselves up in the most holy faith and pray in the Holy Spirit (Jude 20) allows the Spirit to pray through them “in accordance with the will of God” (Romans 8:26–27). Such prayer is powerful

[9] build themselves up in the most holy faith and pray in the Holy Spirit (Jude 20) allows the Spirit to pray through them “in accordance with the will of God” (Romans 8:26–27). Such prayer is powerful to bring victory in the spiritual battle in the world.

[10] pray and praise through them in a heavenly language opens the will and purposes of God to strengthen each for the challenges faced in spiritual warfare (Romans 8:26–27; Jude 20).  In the letter to the Ephesians, Paul challenged believers in spiritual warfare “to put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes” (Ephesians 6:11). Spiritual warfare is not against humans; instead, it is with spiritual forces of evil. Standing against such is possible because of the armor provided by God— “the belt of truth . . . the breastplate of righteousness . . . feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace . . . the shield of faith . . . the helmet of salvation . . . the sword of the Spirit” (Ephesians 6:14–17). Paul concluded the presentation of the resources provided the believer for spiritual warfare with a reminder of the power of prayer in the Spirit (Ephesians 6:18).

There are some in congregations with emotional and mental challenges which might be helped by medical and counseling professionals. In some instances, the medical profession could be of more assistance than a deliverance ministry. Making use of professional help would not be instead of fervent prayer and intercession. God has the power to heal all of humanity’s illnesses. Great care and dependence on the guidance of the Holy Spirit are needed to determine the best path toward wholeness and healing.  Congregations have the privilege of not only being strengthened to fight personally but also to engage spiritual warfare in a corporate act of intercession.

The body of Christ can see the victory of God through intercessory prayer and actions as needed.  The apostle Paul provided the assurance needed for all believers as they engage in spiritual warfare. “What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? . . . in all things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us” (Romans 8:31–32, 37). Peter, as he begins his second epistle, provided this great assurance: “His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness” (2 Peter 1:3).

Wagnells published all 333 pages of Is Hell Eternal? or Will God’s Plan Fail? in 1920. Hav-

gave him liberty to give out what had become a very precious truth to him.” Critics 
could only wonder, however, whose voice he had heard. 
Pridgeon was not the only Pentecostal to raise questions about the fi  nal des-
tiny of the wicked. Charles F. Parham had once taught that God would annihilate 
all unbelievers in the fi  nal judgment. Later he changed his mind to say that hell’s 
eternal fl  ames would reach only those who had become “utter reprobates.” Neither 
Pridgeon’s nor Parham’s views represented the vast majority of Pentecostals. Max 
Wood Moorhead, a former missionary to India and like Pridgeon a former Presbyte-
rian, challenged Pridgeon’s argument. “If all men are by nature children of God and

scripture which tells of the wrath of God being poured out on the earth came to my 
mind” (Revelation 16). At that moment, she didn’t know that hundreds of thousands 
were being burned to death because of fi  res sparked by the earthquake. 
“As I  looked,” she recounted to a wide-eyed gathering of believers at Central 
Assembly of God in Springfi  eld, Missouri, “this cherub seemed to change, and it was 
Jesus Himself. He was standing with His hands outstretched, and I cannot describe the 
awful agony on His face. It seemed as though He were pleading with the people. When 
I afterwards learned of the awfulness of that calamity, I knew that God had shown me

3. The guilty share in the punishment of God’s enemies. 
The Bible makes it clear that the lake of fire was not created for people but for the devil  
and his angels (Matthew 25:41). God’s purpose and desire for humanity has always been 
good. God does not want “anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance” (2 Peter 
3:9). Nevertheless, God will not allow Satan to spoil the new heavens and new earth that 
are to come. God will cast him in the lake of fire. Those who follow Satan against God will 
share in that judgment (John 16:8, 11) because evil’s removal is necessary from God’s 
new creation for God’s new creation to be wholly good. 
 
The nature of our sin against God is like the nature of Satan’s  rebellion. Both are a 
rejection of God and His good plan. God provided a way for humanity’s reconciliation. 
The price of that costly way was the death of the Son of God. Many have chosen to accept

[16] healing as a substitute for obedience to the rules of physical and mental health. Jesus recognized the need of the disciples to get away from the crowds and rest awhile (Mark 6:31). Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, advised him to delegate some of his responsibilities so that he could stand the strain of leading Israel (Exodus 18:17,18).  Neither is divine healing a means of avoiding the effects of old age. Moses did retain a clear eye and his natural strength until the day of his death (Deuteronomy 34:7), but this privilege was not granted to King David (1 Kings 1:1–4). The gradual breakdown of old age, pictured so graphically in Ecclesiastes 12:1–7, is the common experience of believers as well as unbelievers. Healing is still available to the aged, but the part that is healed usually continues to age like the rest of the body. We do not yet have the redemption of the body.  It is possible that the refusal to alter one’s lifestyle to accord with biblical principles could hinder healing

In most Assemblies of God churches today, it is hard to imagine a service without 
a song leader. Nonetheless, early Pentecostal meetings often did not have designated 
song leaders. In fact, no one selected songs ahead of time, the instrumentalists did 
not rehearse, and no one bothered to write an “order of service.” Members of the con-
gregation were free, if led by the Spirit, to lead out in any song they wished. Special 
musical numbers took place on the spot, with no rehearsal. Pentecostal gatherings 
were intentionally informal to allow for maximum participation of the congregation in 
the worship service through songs, testimonies, and manifestations of the Spirit. In all, 
the Spirit was the guide.

As congregations grew in size and respectability, many among both leaders and 
laity viewed the “chaos” of their heritage as unsophisticated and wanted more struc-
ture and dignity in worship. This required a greater degree of leadership in the area of 
music. As a result, volunteer worship leaders or a member of the pastoral staff selected 
songs and led the congregation in singing. Eventually, the full-time “minister of music” 
emerged, with song styles and singing methods related to his or her age and level of 
training.
In this way, they inﬂ uenced tremendously the beliefs and understandings of the 
congregation. Besides leading in worship, the music minister may be responsible for 
directing a choir as well as organizing Christmas and Easter productions.

[5] directing a choir as well as organizing Christmas and Easter productions.
Today, the term “worship leader” not only refers to a song leader or minister of 
music, but to the leader of a “worship team.” The leader may be the minister of music 
or a layperson. Worship teams lead congregations in singing and praise by their singing 
and playing musical instruments on the platform with the assistance of microphones. The 
words of the songs are often shown to the congregation through the use of a projector.
With increasing demand by parishioners for freedom in worship, the worship 
leader is now faced with balancing freshness in worship with excellence in music. 
Many are ﬁ  nding a ﬁ  ne line between entertainment and worship. With well-organized,

[7] Before long, Holdock told Cargnel to be ready to 
preach, since the church still lacked a pastor. “What! me 
preach! I  hardly know the Old Testament from the New 
Testament—are you kidding me? I can’t preach,” she pro-
tested. Telling her to go home and study her Bible and pray, 
he gravely cautioned: “Woe, Woe, unto you if you don’t 
preach,” referring to Paul’s statement in 1 Corinthians 9:16. 
“God has called you, you must obey.” With knees shaking, 
she stood behind the pulpit on the following Sunday, read 
her text, and preached. Pleased with her preaching, he told 
her to prepare another sermon, adding the same solemn 
“Woe, Woe.”

As she continued preaching and with no other minister yet in sight, the con-
gregation unanimously voted her in as pastor. She was seventeen. Shortly after, she 
received a ministerial license from the district and began taking correspondence 
courses to further her preparation. Like many Assemblies of God pastors, she learned

names are written in the Lamb’s Book of Life.” Those who are purified and whose name 
is written in the Lamb’s Book of Life may enter the city freely (Rev elation 21:27; 22:14). 
The impure (also listed in  Revelation 21:8) are outside the city and cannot enter 
(Revelation 22:15). C. S. Lewis suggested that “the doors of hell are locked on the inside. 
. . . They enjoy forever the horrible freedom they have demanded, and are therefore self-
enslaved.”3  
 
Yes, hell is a place of torment whose inhabitants experience the absence of good. But 
good is not absent because God does not love everyone. Good is absent because those 
inhabitants have rejected God and have willingly chosen His absence. They prefer the 
presence of evil over the presence of good. That choice now becomes final and eternal. 
This segregation enables salvation to be complete. A restored earth where God himself 
dwells with humanity is the eternal reality of those who have not rejected God (Revelation 
21:3).

creation as a realm without sin or death.

THE FINAL JUDGMENT 
 
Summary 
 
Fundamental Truth 15 of the Assemblies of God Statement of Fundamental Truths, “The 
Final Judgment,” makes four claims regarding God’s final decision on evil. First, there will 
be a final judgment of God. Second, the dead will be resurrected and judged according 
to their works and whether their name is in the Book of Life. Third, the guilty will share in 
the punishment of the devil and his angels, the Beast, and the False Prophet. Finally, this 
punishment will be everlasting. This paper will offer guidance on dealing with some of the 
more difficult questions regarding the doctrine of hell  and clarify why the Assemblies of 
God does not affirm universalism/ultimate reconciliation or annihilationism/conditionalism. 
This document contains guidelines for ministers on how to teach about God’s judgment.

[5] Preliminary Concerns 
 
The Problem of Hell 
Some have called the doctrine of hell the most disturbing doctrine in Christian theology. 
The traditional interpretation of hell  emphasizes God’s final judgment  as an eternal 
punishment imposed by God (Matthew 25:41; Mark 9:46– 48; 2 Thessalonians 1:6– 9; 
Jude 7; Revelation 14:11 ; 20:10–15). Since much of the imagery surrounding this  
punishment involves fire, a debate among traditionalists has been whether to interpret the 
fire as symbolic or literal. Scholars sometimes call t his traditional view of hell  “Eternal 
Conscious Torment” or ECT.  
 
For much of church history, both the traditional understanding of hell as a place of eternal 
torment imposed by God and the biblical character of God have been in tension. Old 
Testament writers described God throughout the Old Testament as a “ compassionate 
and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness”

[6] Testament writers described God throughout the Old Testament as a “ compassionate 
and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness”
1 (Exodus 34:6; see 
also Nehemiah 9:17;  Psalms 86:15; 103:8; 145:8; Joel 2:13 ; Jonah 4:2). The New 
Testament states that “God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son” (John 
3:16) because God “does not want anyone to be destroyed”2 (2 Peter 3:9, NLT). Finally, 
“God is love” (1 John 4:8). How do we reconcile eternal torment coming from an eternally 
loving God? If it is hard to reconcile the existence of suffering with the character of God, 
how much more of a challenge is the existence of hell?

At the same time, the Old Testament writers record God’s commitment to justice. “All his 
acts are just and true” (Daniel 4:37, NLT). The Psalms and the Prophets repeatedly affirm 
that God is just ( Psalms 11:7; 33:5; 50:6; 89:14; 101:1; 140:12; Isaiah 5:16 ; 30:18; 
Jeremiah 9:24; Ezekiel 34:16; Amos 5:24; Malachi 2:17) . The Bible promises that Jesus 
will judge the world with justice (Acts 17:31; Hebrews 1:8; Revelation 19:11). How do we 
reconcile eternal punishment as a just punishment for sin, no matter how severe, when 
all sin is temporal ? Where is justice in a punishment that is only punitive and not 
redemptive? How can an eternal place of torment be the decision of a just God?  
 
Accepting the idea that the punishment of God is everlasting leads to other questions, 
including the fate of the unevangelized. Can people receive the salvation offered in Christ 
apart from hearing the message of the gospel ? If not, s hould they be judged as if they

[9] including the fate of the unevangelized. Can people receive the salvation offered in Christ 
apart from hearing the message of the gospel ? If not, s hould they be judged as if they 
had rejected the message they did not receive? Again, does this fit with the character of 
a just and loving God? 
 
Alternative Views to Eternal Punishment 
Considering this tension between the nature of hell and the character of a loving and just 
God, other options are possible in place of the traditional or ECT view. One of the best-
known alternative views is the belief that eventually everyone will be saved. This view has 
been ascribed to the early Christian teacher Origen and is also associated with the Early 
Church bishop Gregory of Nyssa. 
 
The early universalist argument was not that the wicked would be saved immediately after 
death or that the wicked could be saved apart from Christ . No one argued for the “all

[10] The early universalist argument was not that the wicked would be saved immediately after 
death or that the wicked could be saved apart from Christ . No one argued for the “all 
roads lead to heaven”  approach of modern-day pluralism. Rather, they believed in the 
existence of hell as a place of temporary punishment. Here, the wicked could be purified 
and eventually repent of their sins and  be reconciled to God.  In this view,  sometimes 
referred to as universal or ultimate restoration/reconciliation, hell functions as a place of 
redemption.  
 
Christian defenders of universalism or universal reconciliation support their views with 
biblical passages describing the character of God or the scope of salvation rather than 
passages on the judgment of the wicked. From those passages, proponents reason their 
way to universalism by arguing that a loving and just God could never punish eternally.

[11] passages on the judgment of the wicked. From those passages, proponents reason their 
way to universalism by arguing that a loving and just God could never punish eternally.  
Verses that say otherwise are reinterpreted so that “eternal” means “of a coming age ” 
rather than “ everlasting.” Other passages offered in support of universal reconciliation  
describe the scope of God’s work in Jesus as reconciler or Lord to include “all” people or 
things, or “every” knee and tongue (Romans 5:18; 1 Corinthians 15:22; Philippians 2:11; 
Colossians 1:20; 1 Timothy 4:10). These passages are interpreted to mean a universal 
reconciliation with God for all of creation, in the end.  
 
Another alternative view to ECT, also tracing back to the Early Church, is annihilationism 
(aka conditional immor tality or conditionalism). This view teaches that temporal 
punishment of the wicked will result in their utter destruction: they cease to exist. Some

punishment of the wicked will result in their utter destruction: they cease to exist. Some 
argue that the nonexistence of the wicked is the extent of their punishment.

3. The guilty share in the punishment of God’s enemies. 
The Bible makes it clear that the lake of fire was not created for people but for the devil  
and his angels (Matthew 25:41). God’s purpose and desire for humanity has always been 
good. God does not want “anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance” (2 Peter 
3:9). Nevertheless, God will not allow Satan to spoil the new heavens and new earth that 
are to come. God will cast him in the lake of fire. Those who follow Satan against God will 
share in that judgment (John 16:8, 11) because evil’s removal is necessary from God’s 
new creation for God’s new creation to be wholly good. 
 
The nature of our sin against God is like the nature of Satan’s  rebellion. Both are a 
rejection of God and His good plan. God provided a way for humanity’s reconciliation. 
The price of that costly way was the death of the Son of God. Many have chosen to accept

[14] rejection of God and His good plan. God provided a way for humanity’s reconciliation. 
The price of that costly way was the death of the Son of God. Many have chosen to accept 
God’s great gift and are no longer a part of that realm of evil. By contrast, there is no hint 
in Scripture that Satan desires reconciliation with God.  His fate of eternal separation is 
just. Those who go into eternity still rejecting God rightly share that eternal separation 
(Hebrews 10:26–31). 
 
Annihiliationism insists that the eternal punishment of the damned will be nonexistence. 
Those found in Christ will live in God’s eternity, while those who reject God’s omission or 
commission will simply remain dead (or else be resurrected to face judgment, then face 
nonexistence).  
 
The argument that the wicked share the same judgment as death and the grave or Hades 
(Revelation 20:14–15) and are therefore destroyed misses the point. Death and Hades

[15] nonexistence).  
 
The argument that the wicked share the same judgment as death and the grave or Hades 
(Revelation 20:14–15) and are therefore destroyed misses the point. Death and Hades 
are not beings  or persons. They are temporary states of existence and someday 
eliminated when all their residents are gone (1 Corinthians 15:53–56; Revelation 21:4). 
Annihilationism errs in that it does not eliminate death but rather elevates it to a permanent 
state. 
 
If Satan is to be tormented “day and night for ever and ever” (Revelation 20:10), that also 
defines the punishment of those who choose to follow Satan’s example instead of 
receiving the grace of God. The nature of Sin (with a capital S ) is such that it entails the 
rejection of God, leading to actions known as sins ( lowercase s). Paul makes this 
distinction in Romans 6, where he wr ote about dying to Sin (Romans 6:1– 14) with the 
result of no longer needing to commit acts of sin (Romans 6:15–23).

[16] distinction in Romans 6, where he wr ote about dying to Sin (Romans 6:1– 14) with the 
result of no longer needing to commit acts of sin (Romans 6:15–23).  
  
4. The punishment of the guilty will be everlasting. 
One of the key questions regarding interpreting these Scriptures is the nature of eternity. 
The Bible applies terminology for eternity to both salvation and judgment ( Daniel 12:2; 
Matthew 18:8 ; 25:41, 46; Hebrews 6:2 ; Jude 7) . What does eternity  mean in these 
contexts?  
 
One way of interpreting eternity is that it means “everlasting” or “unending.” Another way 
some interpret eternal is “the age to come” (in contrast to this age, which will go away). 
For example, Matthew 25:46 uses the phrase “eternal [aionion] punishment.” Some deny 
that this means eternal in the sense of absolutely unending. In the same verse, however,

[17] 6 
Jesus uses the same word of “eternal life” (aionion) in a manner that is directly and exactly 
parallel. In other words, eternal punishment will be as everlasting as eternal life. This 
leaves no room for later restoration of the wicked.  
 
Another New Testament passage refers to eternal punishment as “ eternal judgment,” a 
judgment that is valid eternally (Hebrews 6:2). This “everlasting destruction” (or separation) 
is “from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might” (2 Thessalonians 1:9). In 
these passages the word death speaks of spiritual death or separation from God. 
Therefore, eternal judgment brings a final and eternal separation from God.  
 
Because the salvation of creation depends on God’s  judgment of evil and the testimony 
of Scripture speaks to the finality of God’s  judgment, the Assemblies of God considers 
any form of universalism to be an error.
4 The rich man of Luke 16:19– 31, already in

[18] of Scripture speaks to the finality of God’s  judgment, the Assemblies of God considers 
any form of universalism to be an error.
4 The rich man of Luke 16:19– 31, already in 
torment, seeks easing of his pain and asks that a warning go to his brothers . He never 
asks for reconciliation with God. His rejection is ongoing.  Near the end of John’s  vision, 
the angel says, “Let the one who does wrong continue to do wrong; let the vile person 
continue to be vile; let the one who does right continue to do right; and let the holy person 
continue to be holy.” (Revelation 22:11). 
 
The Bible offers no possibility of repentance after death nor a lessening of the torment of 
separation from God (Luke 16:23–26). Some call universalism “God’s favorite heresy” for 
its picture of none perishing.  We understand God to be at work saving all who will be 
saved according to their will.  The Assemblies of God teaches that humans retain the 
power to resist God’s grace regardless of His will.

[19] saved according to their will.  The Assemblies of God teaches that humans retain the 
power to resist God’s grace regardless of His will.
5 That “none perish” reflects the will of 
God, yet  that does not translate into universal salvation because of human freedom. 
Universalism lacks scriptural support. This is why those who say all are saved according 
to God’s will alone must also argue that God chooses some for damnation because 
Scripture does not teach universal salvation.  
 
Conclusion 
 
The Assemblies of God reject s both the doctrines of ultimate reconciliation and 
annihilationism based on its understanding of Scripture, rooted in Revelation 20:10 –15 
but including other texts which describe the final judgment of God (Matthew 18:6 –9; 
25:31–46; Mark 9:42–48; 2 Thessalonians 1:8–9; Jude 7; Revelation 14:9 –11; 21:8, 27; 
22:11, 15 ). A doctrine of universalism harms both soteriology and eschatology, and thus 
causes more damage than a doctrine of annihiliationism.

[20] 22:11, 15 ). A doctrine of universalism harms both soteriology and eschatology, and thus 
causes more damage than a doctrine of annihiliationism. 
 
The Assemblies of God rejects both positions and holds that the best interpretation of 
Scripture is that hell is eternal separation from God and His goodness and is, therefore, 
an eternal punishment. The Bible’s teaching about this final judgment has a redemptive 
purpose and intends to draw people to salvation.  The warnings are there so that none 
should perish and be condemned (John 3:16). 
 
4 Universalism belongs to the category of “eschatological errors” the promotion of which can be a cause for ministerial 
discipline as stated in the Bylaws of the General Council of the Assemblies of God, Article IX. B, Section 3.

[21] A BIBLICALLY INFORMED RESPONSE TO THE SIN OF RACISM POSITION PAPER (ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL PRESBYTERY IN SESSION AUGUST 1, 2023)  Introduction The Assemblies of God affirms racism is a sin and calls for repentance for those who participate in it and those who fail to address it. In 1989, at the 43rd General Council, the church adopted a resolution on racism that reaffirmed a long-standing position of the church. “The Assemblies of God oppose the sin of racism in any form” and calls “any and all to repentance who have participated in the sin of racism through personal thought or action, or through church and social structures, or through inactivity in addressing racism as individuals or as a church.”1   Racism is a supporting combination of assumptions, beliefs, and practices that categorizes groups of people along a spectrum, from superior to inferior, based on physical characteristics (such as color of skin and eyes, and type of hair), ancestry, language, and region of origin. This

[22] groups of people along a spectrum, from superior to inferior, based on physical characteristics (such as color of skin and eyes, and type of hair), ancestry, language, and region of origin. This categorization justifies disdain, hatred, and inequitable treatment against those deemed inferior and social advantages for those deemed superior. All forms of racism, as well as all the various means of justification and rationalization offered by its proponents, fall short and run counter to the biblical teaching regarding human equality before God. Consequently, a biblically informed response recognizes that all expressions of racism are sinful because they demean God’s good creation, undermine human dignity, and violate biblical standards of justice.  Biblical Perspective on Racism The Bible, the Word of God, is the final arbiter of faith and practice for followers of Jesus. It reveals God’s will and purposes for humans, indeed for all creation. It is completely authoritative, does not

[23] the Word of God, is the final arbiter of faith and practice for followers of Jesus. It reveals God’s will and purposes for humans, indeed for all creation. It is completely authoritative, does not fail, and cannot be defeated. The biblical teaching and message, rather than cultural or ideological perspectives, must be determinative of what the Church believes and how it lives out its beliefs in the world. The Bible presents the unity and diversity of the plan of God for humans, calls for equal standing before Him for all humans, and demands that His justice be conducted within the human realm.

The opposition of the Assemblies of God to racism was reaffirmed by, Executive Presbytery, “Statement on George Floyd, Racism, and Racial Reconciliation,” June 3, 2020.

[25] Unity and Diversity in God’s Plan  The theology surrounding the creation of the universe and humanity is important in considering the plan of God for both unity and diversity. The Triune God created the first human pair in God’s image and likeness (Genesis 1:26–27) as male and female with the responsibilities to populate the earth and to steward other created life forms.   After the Fall into sin, recorded in Genesis 3, the text explains that Adam’s wife “would become the mother of all the living”2 (Genesis 3:20). This intentional comment links all human beings together as one family. The judgment on human sin by the Flood (Genesis 6–9) did not deter God from His plan for unity and diversity. Genesis 10 reveals the great diversity among humans that descended from the sons of Noah.   Similar themes emerge in the New Testament. For example, in his speech in Athens (Acts 17:16–31), Paul announced the one God who made the world and everything in it. In that creation event, “from one man

[26] themes emerge in the New Testament. For example, in his speech in Athens (Acts 17:16–31), Paul announced the one God who made the world and everything in it. In that creation event, “from one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth” (Acts 17:26). Additionally, in Romans 5:12–21, Paul taught that the creation of the one man unites the entirety of humankind and directs them to the one God who is reaching out redemptively to them.  Equal Standing before God  The opposition of the Assemblies of God to racism is based on various biblical teachings, beginning with God’s creation of all humans in His image (Genesis 1:27; 5:1–2). Therefore, all racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, biological sex, other biological differences, or cultural distinctions that are used to devalue and diminish the status of humans are sinful at their core.  Unfortunately, because of the reality of the fallen condition, the perspective is not held universally. Many, including some within the

[27] and diminish the status of humans are sinful at their core.  Unfortunately, because of the reality of the fallen condition, the perspective is not held universally. Many, including some within the Church, reject such equal valuation of all humans, tending to judgments that lead to diminishing the personhood of some individuals and groups. Yet, the Bible clearly teaches, directly and indirectly, the equality of all human beings.   First, Israel, created by the Lord as the people of promise and witness to the world, received from Him the message that they would be a blessing to all (Genesis 12:2–3; 18:16–19). Throughout the Old Testament, God blessed peoples outside of Israel (Hagar in Genesis 16; Egypt in Genesis 41; Rahab in Joshua 6; Ruth in Ruth 4; the widow of Zarephath in 1 Kings 17; Naaman in 2 Kings 5, etc.) due to their connection to Israelites. God offered promises of blessing to other nations in relationship to God’s self (Isaiah 19:25; Jeremiah 48:47).  Second, the Law God

Second, the Law God gave to Israel was to be applied to everyone, native-born and foreigners. God displayed His acceptance of all humans equally by having the Law applied to everyone, in the same manner (Exodus 12:17–19; Leviticus 17:10–15; Numbers 15:27–31).

[29] Elements of Biblical Justice  A significant consideration in the Assemblies of God’s opposition to racism is that racism violates the concept of biblical justice. Justice is a biblical theme that is developed from an understanding of the nature of God, who himself is just and righteous (Deuteronomy 10:18; 32:4; Job 37:23; Psalm 9:7; 10:17–18; 33:4–5; Isaiah 5:16; 30:18; Hosea 12:6). As the holy and just Sovereign of the creation, God expects justice (Micah 6:8). Consequently, when we act unjustly, whether with respect to race or any other personal characteristic, we go against the divine nature and order.    A foundational element of biblical justice is the understanding that God intended for human beings to be a community from the beginning (Genesis 1:27). Human beings are bound together by far more commonalities than what may distinguish them from one another. Every member of the community shares the threats and injuries against other members. In the same way, the successes are

[30] by far more commonalities than what may distinguish them from one another. Every member of the community shares the threats and injuries against other members. In the same way, the successes are shared. This demands that each person in the community assume care and responsibilities for all others in the community. It is far too easy to lose the sense of community as populations grow, but biblical justice begins with this understanding.  In biblical justice, there is a place for identifying with the sins of the larger community and calling out in confession for forgiveness (Nehemiah 1:1–11; Daniel 9:1–19). For both Nehemiah and Daniel, there was a release of God’s intervention when they prayed, confessing the sins of the people. They wanted God to express His forgiveness to the community.   Additionally, biblical justice recognizes that people have individual responsibility before God. For example, both Jeremiah and Ezekiel warned Israel explicitly that they could not merely blame

[31] Additionally, biblical justice recognizes that people have individual responsibility before God. For example, both Jeremiah and Ezekiel warned Israel explicitly that they could not merely blame their sin on the larger community (Jeremiah 31:29–30; Ezekiel 18:1–4). The community at large needs to repent, asking for the forgiveness of God for all forms of injustice and the failure to speak against it. However, individuals cannot escape their personal need to do the same.  The Scriptures are clear that racism must not only be addressed on an individual basis, but also corporately, whether in the church or the world. For example, the institutional understanding of the relationship between lender and borrower would allow the lender to charge interest and to receive a pledge for the loan. However, this system could be oppressive, so the Lord provided relief for those who would be harmed by the institution (Exodus 22:25–27). The prophet Jeremiah warns against those who use the system to

[32] this system could be oppressive, so the Lord provided relief for those who would be harmed by the institution (Exodus 22:25–27). The prophet Jeremiah warns against those who use the system to harm others: “Woe to him who builds his palace by unrighteousness, his upper rooms by injustice, making his own people work for nothing, not paying them for their labor” (Jeremiah 22:13). In the New Testament, James similarly warns those he identifies as rich for failing to honor laborers for their labor (James 5:1–6).  The moral and ethical principles behind these Scriptural commands necessitate equal opportunity not only in lending institutions or compensation but should also apply to other practices and processes. As individuals and as a church we should oppose any practice or process that results in unfair or harmful treatment of individuals because of race.  Biblical justice calls for people to be concerned for those who are oppressed. Isaiah’s message noted the sinful condition of Israel

[33] in unfair or harmful treatment of individuals because of race.  Biblical justice calls for people to be concerned for those who are oppressed. Isaiah’s message noted the sinful condition of Israel and urged them to repent. As part of the change that repentance would bring them, he noted they should “defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow” (Isaiah 1:17). The Psalmist pronounced a blessing on those who “have regard for the weak” (Psalm 41:1). The writer of Proverbs offered an additional challenge for readers to “speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy” (Proverbs 31:8–9).

[34] The description of biblical justice provided in the foregoing provides the basis of a thorough critique of racism, a critique so penetrating that the only label fitting for such beliefs and actions is sin. Racism goes against God’s nature and order. Racism violates community. Racism is both an individual and corporate attack on justice that Christians must seriously address. Racism undermines the deeply Christian virtue of concern for those who are oppressed.  Summary Racism, acknowledged or ignored, is part of the present world situation. As believers, we have an opportunity to be salt and light as Spirit-empowered witnesses. The following are suggestions for ministers and members.  First, as noted in the 1989 resolution on racism, “we call any and all to repentance who have participated in the sin of racism through personal thought or action, or through church and social structures, or through inactivity in addressing racism as individuals or as a church.”3 The Church, collectively

[35] in the sin of racism through personal thought or action, or through church and social structures, or through inactivity in addressing racism as individuals or as a church.”3 The Church, collectively and individually, must repent of the sin of racism expressed, in both attitudes and behavior. Racism harms others who bear the image of God. Where the members or churches in the AG community are guilty of racism, repentance and turning away from such is a needful first step.   Second, the Church must acknowledge the image of God in all people and live out teachings about the equality of people in the Bible. God created humanity with diversity and affirming that diversity goes hand in hand with affirming human equality. Furthermore, the cross of Jesus testifies to and provides for ultimate reconciliation, not only of people with God but also of human to human. Barriers, hatreds, suspicions, unequal treatment, and the like have been healed by the shedding of His blood (Galatians 3:28;

[36] reconciliation, not only of people with God but also of human to human. Barriers, hatreds, suspicions, unequal treatment, and the like have been healed by the shedding of His blood (Galatians 3:28; Ephesians 2:14). We are new creatures, showing the world what God’s love looks like and evidencing that love in every circumstance with all people. The Church must live out in actuality what Christ provided for in His atonement and must demonstrate this truth in a fallen and divided world.  Third, the Church needs to model the inclusiveness of the body of Christ. The eradication of racism demands including others in the circles of ministry and leadership.4 To exclude fellow believers from leadership because of race is incompatible with seeing all humans as God’s creations in whom He has placed great value and for whom Christ died. A broad diversity, in all the ways that we are legitimately diverse, must become a part of our thinking and planning for the full expression and plan of God to be

[37] value and for whom Christ died. A broad diversity, in all the ways that we are legitimately diverse, must become a part of our thinking and planning for the full expression and plan of God to be revealed.  Finally, the Church must recognize and decry racism in all of its forms. Not every human system is, by definition, racist. However, any human system can limit opportunities for others based on race and prevent them from advancing in society. When those are noted, the Church should not be silent; it should demand change with humility and grace.

is written in the Lamb’s Book of Life may enter the city freely (Rev elation 21:27; 22:14). 
The impure (also listed in  Revelation 21:8) are outside the city and cannot enter 
(Revelation 22:15). C. S. Lewis suggested that “the doors of hell are locked on the inside. 
. . . They enjoy forever the horrible freedom they have demanded, and are therefore self-
enslaved.”3  
 
Yes, hell is a place of torment whose inhabitants experience the absence of good. But 
good is not absent because God does not love everyone. Good is absent because those 
inhabitants have rejected God and have willingly chosen His absence. They prefer the 
presence of evil over the presence of good. That choice now becomes final and eternal. 
This segregation enables salvation to be complete. A restored earth where God himself 
dwells with humanity is the eternal reality of those who have not rejected God (Revelation 
21:3).

The gates of the New Jerusalem remain open for the nations who will bring their own “glory and honor” into it (Revelation 21:26), with all human beings united in equal standing before God without sacrificing their unique diversity.

THE FINAL JUDGMENT 
 
Summary 
 
Fundamental Truth 15 of the Assemblies of God Statement of Fundamental Truths, “The 
Final Judgment,” makes four claims regarding God’s final decision on evil. First, there will 
be a final judgment of God. Second, the dead will be resurrected and judged according 
to their works and whether their name is in the Book of Life. Third, the guilty will share in 
the punishment of the devil and his angels, the Beast, and the False Prophet. Finally, this 
punishment will be everlasting. This paper will offer guidance on dealing with some of the 
more difficult questions regarding the doctrine of hell  and clarify why the Assemblies of 
God does not affirm universalism/ultimate reconciliation or annihilationism/conditionalism. 
This document contains guidelines for ministers on how to teach about God’s judgment. 
 
Preliminary Concerns 
 
The Problem of Hell 
Some have called the doctrine of hell the most disturbing doctrine in Christian theology.

[5] Preliminary Concerns 
 
The Problem of Hell 
Some have called the doctrine of hell the most disturbing doctrine in Christian theology. 
The traditional interpretation of hell  emphasizes God’s final judgment  as an eternal 
punishment imposed by God (Matthew 25:41; Mark 9:46– 48; 2 Thessalonians 1:6– 9; 
Jude 7; Revelation 14:11 ; 20:10–15). Since much of the imagery surrounding this  
punishment involves fire, a debate among traditionalists has been whether to interpret the 
fire as symbolic or literal. Scholars sometimes call t his traditional view of hell  “Eternal 
Conscious Torment” or ECT.  
 
For much of church history, both the traditional understanding of hell as a place of eternal 
torment imposed by God and the biblical character of God have been in tension. Old 
Testament writers described God throughout the Old Testament as a “ compassionate 
and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness”
1 (Exodus 34:6; see

[6] Testament writers described God throughout the Old Testament as a “ compassionate 
and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness”
1 (Exodus 34:6; see 
also Nehemiah 9:17;  Psalms 86:15; 103:8; 145:8; Joel 2:13 ; Jonah 4:2). The New 
Testament states that “God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son” (John 
3:16) because God “does not want anyone to be destroyed”2 (2 Peter 3:9, NLT). Finally, 
“God is love” (1 John 4:8). How do we reconcile eternal torment coming from an eternally 
loving God? If it is hard to reconcile the existence of suffering with the character of God, 
how much more of a challenge is the existence of hell?

At the same time, the Old Testament writers record God’s commitment to justice. “All his 
acts are just and true” (Daniel 4:37, NLT). The Psalms and the Prophets repeatedly affirm 
that God is just ( Psalms 11:7; 33:5; 50:6; 89:14; 101:1; 140:12; Isaiah 5:16 ; 30:18; 
Jeremiah 9:24; Ezekiel 34:16; Amos 5:24; Malachi 2:17) . The Bible promises that Jesus 
will judge the world with justice (Acts 17:31; Hebrews 1:8; Revelation 19:11). How do we 
reconcile eternal punishment as a just punishment for sin, no matter how severe, when 
all sin is temporal ? Where is justice in a punishment that is only punitive and not 
redemptive? How can an eternal place of torment be the decision of a just God?  
 
Accepting the idea that the punishment of God is everlasting leads to other questions, 
including the fate of the unevangelized. Can people receive the salvation offered in Christ 
apart from hearing the message of the gospel ? If not, s hould they be judged as if they

[9] including the fate of the unevangelized. Can people receive the salvation offered in Christ 
apart from hearing the message of the gospel ? If not, s hould they be judged as if they 
had rejected the message they did not receive? Again, does this fit with the character of 
a just and loving God? 
 
Alternative Views to Eternal Punishment 
Considering this tension between the nature of hell and the character of a loving and just 
God, other options are possible in place of the traditional or ECT view. One of the best-
known alternative views is the belief that eventually everyone will be saved. This view has 
been ascribed to the early Christian teacher Origen and is also associated with the Early 
Church bishop Gregory of Nyssa. 
 
The early universalist argument was not that the wicked would be saved immediately after 
death or that the wicked could be saved apart from Christ . No one argued for the “all

[10] The early universalist argument was not that the wicked would be saved immediately after 
death or that the wicked could be saved apart from Christ . No one argued for the “all 
roads lead to heaven”  approach of modern-day pluralism. Rather, they believed in the 
existence of hell as a place of temporary punishment. Here, the wicked could be purified 
and eventually repent of their sins and  be reconciled to God.  In this view,  sometimes 
referred to as universal or ultimate restoration/reconciliation, hell functions as a place of 
redemption.  
 
Christian defenders of universalism or universal reconciliation support their views with 
biblical passages describing the character of God or the scope of salvation rather than 
passages on the judgment of the wicked. From those passages, proponents reason their 
way to universalism by arguing that a loving and just God could never punish eternally.

[11] passages on the judgment of the wicked. From those passages, proponents reason their 
way to universalism by arguing that a loving and just God could never punish eternally.  
Verses that say otherwise are reinterpreted so that “eternal” means “of a coming age ” 
rather than “ everlasting.” Other passages offered in support of universal reconciliation  
describe the scope of God’s work in Jesus as reconciler or Lord to include “all” people or 
things, or “every” knee and tongue (Romans 5:18; 1 Corinthians 15:22; Philippians 2:11; 
Colossians 1:20; 1 Timothy 4:10). These passages are interpreted to mean a universal 
reconciliation with God for all of creation, in the end.  
 
Another alternative view to ECT, also tracing back to the Early Church, is annihilationism 
(aka conditional immor tality or conditionalism). This view teaches that temporal 
punishment of the wicked will result in their utter destruction: they cease to exist. Some

[12] (aka conditional immor tality or conditionalism). This view teaches that temporal 
punishment of the wicked will result in their utter destruction: they cease to exist. Some 
argue that the nonexistence of the wicked is the extent of their punishment.

3. The guilty share in the punishment of God’s enemies. 
The Bible makes it clear that the lake of fire was not created for people but for the devil  
and his angels (Matthew 25:41). God’s purpose and desire for humanity has always been 
good. God does not want “anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance” (2 Peter 
3:9). Nevertheless, God will not allow Satan to spoil the new heavens and new earth that 
are to come. God will cast him in the lake of fire. Those who follow Satan against God will 
share in that judgment (John 16:8, 11) because evil’s removal is necessary from God’s 
new creation for God’s new creation to be wholly good. 
 
The nature of our sin against God is like the nature of Satan’s  rebellion. Both are a 
rejection of God and His good plan. God provided a way for humanity’s reconciliation. 
The price of that costly way was the death of the Son of God. Many have chosen to accept

[14] rejection of God and His good plan. God provided a way for humanity’s reconciliation. 
The price of that costly way was the death of the Son of God. Many have chosen to accept 
God’s great gift and are no longer a part of that realm of evil. By contrast, there is no hint 
in Scripture that Satan desires reconciliation with God.  His fate of eternal separation is 
just. Those who go into eternity still rejecting God rightly share that eternal separation 
(Hebrews 10:26–31). 
 
Annihiliationism insists that the eternal punishment of the damned will be nonexistence. 
Those found in Christ will live in God’s eternity, while those who reject God’s omission or 
commission will simply remain dead (or else be resurrected to face judgment, then face 
nonexistence).  
 
The argument that the wicked share the same judgment as death and the grave or Hades 
(Revelation 20:14–15) and are therefore destroyed misses the point. Death and Hades

[15] nonexistence).  
 
The argument that the wicked share the same judgment as death and the grave or Hades 
(Revelation 20:14–15) and are therefore destroyed misses the point. Death and Hades 
are not beings  or persons. They are temporary states of existence and someday 
eliminated when all their residents are gone (1 Corinthians 15:53–56; Revelation 21:4). 
Annihilationism errs in that it does not eliminate death but rather elevates it to a permanent 
state. 
 
If Satan is to be tormented “day and night for ever and ever” (Revelation 20:10), that also 
defines the punishment of those who choose to follow Satan’s example instead of 
receiving the grace of God. The nature of Sin (with a capital S ) is such that it entails the 
rejection of God, leading to actions known as sins ( lowercase s). Paul makes this 
distinction in Romans 6, where he wr ote about dying to Sin (Romans 6:1– 14) with the 
result of no longer needing to commit acts of sin (Romans 6:15–23).

[16] distinction in Romans 6, where he wr ote about dying to Sin (Romans 6:1– 14) with the 
result of no longer needing to commit acts of sin (Romans 6:15–23).  
  
4. The punishment of the guilty will be everlasting. 
One of the key questions regarding interpreting these Scriptures is the nature of eternity. 
The Bible applies terminology for eternity to both salvation and judgment ( Daniel 12:2; 
Matthew 18:8 ; 25:41, 46; Hebrews 6:2 ; Jude 7) . What does eternity  mean in these 
contexts?  
 
One way of interpreting eternity is that it means “everlasting” or “unending.” Another way 
some interpret eternal is “the age to come” (in contrast to this age, which will go away). 
For example, Matthew 25:46 uses the phrase “eternal [aionion] punishment.” Some deny 
that this means eternal in the sense of absolutely unending. In the same verse, however,

[17] 6 
Jesus uses the same word of “eternal life” (aionion) in a manner that is directly and exactly 
parallel. In other words, eternal punishment will be as everlasting as eternal life. This 
leaves no room for later restoration of the wicked.  
 
Another New Testament passage refers to eternal punishment as “ eternal judgment,” a 
judgment that is valid eternally (Hebrews 6:2). This “everlasting destruction” (or separation) 
is “from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might” (2 Thessalonians 1:9). In 
these passages the word death speaks of spiritual death or separation from God. 
Therefore, eternal judgment brings a final and eternal separation from God.  
 
Because the salvation of creation depends on God’s  judgment of evil and the testimony 
of Scripture speaks to the finality of God’s  judgment, the Assemblies of God considers 
any form of universalism to be an error.
4 The rich man of Luke 16:19– 31, already in

[18] of Scripture speaks to the finality of God’s  judgment, the Assemblies of God considers 
any form of universalism to be an error.
4 The rich man of Luke 16:19– 31, already in 
torment, seeks easing of his pain and asks that a warning go to his brothers . He never 
asks for reconciliation with God. His rejection is ongoing.  Near the end of John’s  vision, 
the angel says, “Let the one who does wrong continue to do wrong; let the vile person 
continue to be vile; let the one who does right continue to do right; and let the holy person 
continue to be holy.” (Revelation 22:11). 
 
The Bible offers no possibility of repentance after death nor a lessening of the torment of 
separation from God (Luke 16:23–26). Some call universalism “God’s favorite heresy” for 
its picture of none perishing.  We understand God to be at work saving all who will be 
saved according to their will.  The Assemblies of God teaches that humans retain the 
power to resist God’s grace regardless of His will.

[19] saved according to their will.  The Assemblies of God teaches that humans retain the 
power to resist God’s grace regardless of His will.
5 That “none perish” reflects the will of 
God, yet  that does not translate into universal salvation because of human freedom. 
Universalism lacks scriptural support. This is why those who say all are saved according 
to God’s will alone must also argue that God chooses some for damnation because 
Scripture does not teach universal salvation.  
 
Conclusion 
 
The Assemblies of God reject s both the doctrines of ultimate reconciliation and 
annihilationism based on its understanding of Scripture, rooted in Revelation 20:10 –15 
but including other texts which describe the final judgment of God (Matthew 18:6 –9; 
25:31–46; Mark 9:42–48; 2 Thessalonians 1:8–9; Jude 7; Revelation 14:9 –11; 21:8, 27; 
22:11, 15 ). A doctrine of universalism harms both soteriology and eschatology, and thus 
causes more damage than a doctrine of annihiliationism.

[20] 22:11, 15 ). A doctrine of universalism harms both soteriology and eschatology, and thus 
causes more damage than a doctrine of annihiliationism. 
 
The Assemblies of God rejects both positions and holds that the best interpretation of 
Scripture is that hell is eternal separation from God and His goodness and is, therefore, 
an eternal punishment. The Bible’s teaching about this final judgment has a redemptive 
purpose and intends to draw people to salvation.  The warnings are there so that none 
should perish and be condemned (John 3:16). 
 
4 Universalism belongs to the category of “eschatological errors” the promotion of which can be a cause for ministerial 
discipline as stated in the Bylaws of the General Council of the Assemblies of God, Article IX. B, Section 3.

[21] A BIBLICALLY INFORMED RESPONSE TO THE SIN OF RACISM POSITION PAPER (ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL PRESBYTERY IN SESSION AUGUST 1, 2023)  Introduction The Assemblies of God affirms racism is a sin and calls for repentance for those who participate in it and those who fail to address it. In 1989, at the 43rd General Council, the church adopted a resolution on racism that reaffirmed a long-standing position of the church. “The Assemblies of God oppose the sin of racism in any form” and calls “any and all to repentance who have participated in the sin of racism through personal thought or action, or through church and social structures, or through inactivity in addressing racism as individuals or as a church.”1   Racism is a supporting combination of assumptions, beliefs, and practices that categorizes groups of people along a spectrum, from superior to inferior, based on physical characteristics (such as color of skin and eyes, and type of hair), ancestry, language, and region of origin. This

[22] groups of people along a spectrum, from superior to inferior, based on physical characteristics (such as color of skin and eyes, and type of hair), ancestry, language, and region of origin. This categorization justifies disdain, hatred, and inequitable treatment against those deemed inferior and social advantages for those deemed superior. All forms of racism, as well as all the various means of justification and rationalization offered by its proponents, fall short and run counter to the biblical teaching regarding human equality before God. Consequently, a biblically informed response recognizes that all expressions of racism are sinful because they demean God’s good creation, undermine human dignity, and violate biblical standards of justice.  Biblical Perspective on Racism The Bible, the Word of God, is the final arbiter of faith and practice for followers of Jesus. It reveals God’s will and purposes for humans, indeed for all creation. It is completely authoritative, does not

[23] the Word of God, is the final arbiter of faith and practice for followers of Jesus. It reveals God’s will and purposes for humans, indeed for all creation. It is completely authoritative, does not fail, and cannot be defeated. The biblical teaching and message, rather than cultural or ideological perspectives, must be determinative of what the Church believes and how it lives out its beliefs in the world. The Bible presents the unity and diversity of the plan of God for humans, calls for equal standing before Him for all humans, and demands that His justice be conducted within the human realm.

The opposition of the Assemblies of God to racism was reaffirmed by, Executive Presbytery, “Statement on George Floyd, Racism, and Racial Reconciliation,” June 3, 2020.

[25] Unity and Diversity in God’s Plan  The theology surrounding the creation of the universe and humanity is important in considering the plan of God for both unity and diversity. The Triune God created the first human pair in God’s image and likeness (Genesis 1:26–27) as male and female with the responsibilities to populate the earth and to steward other created life forms.   After the Fall into sin, recorded in Genesis 3, the text explains that Adam’s wife “would become the mother of all the living”2 (Genesis 3:20). This intentional comment links all human beings together as one family. The judgment on human sin by the Flood (Genesis 6–9) did not deter God from His plan for unity and diversity. Genesis 10 reveals the great diversity among humans that descended from the sons of Noah.   Similar themes emerge in the New Testament. For example, in his speech in Athens (Acts 17:16–31), Paul announced the one God who made the world and everything in it. In that creation event, “from one man

[26] themes emerge in the New Testament. For example, in his speech in Athens (Acts 17:16–31), Paul announced the one God who made the world and everything in it. In that creation event, “from one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth” (Acts 17:26). Additionally, in Romans 5:12–21, Paul taught that the creation of the one man unites the entirety of humankind and directs them to the one God who is reaching out redemptively to them.  Equal Standing before God  The opposition of the Assemblies of God to racism is based on various biblical teachings, beginning with God’s creation of all humans in His image (Genesis 1:27; 5:1–2). Therefore, all racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, biological sex, other biological differences, or cultural distinctions that are used to devalue and diminish the status of humans are sinful at their core.  Unfortunately, because of the reality of the fallen condition, the perspective is not held universally. Many, including some within the

[27] and diminish the status of humans are sinful at their core.  Unfortunately, because of the reality of the fallen condition, the perspective is not held universally. Many, including some within the Church, reject such equal valuation of all humans, tending to judgments that lead to diminishing the personhood of some individuals and groups. Yet, the Bible clearly teaches, directly and indirectly, the equality of all human beings.   First, Israel, created by the Lord as the people of promise and witness to the world, received from Him the message that they would be a blessing to all (Genesis 12:2–3; 18:16–19). Throughout the Old Testament, God blessed peoples outside of Israel (Hagar in Genesis 16; Egypt in Genesis 41; Rahab in Joshua 6; Ruth in Ruth 4; the widow of Zarephath in 1 Kings 17; Naaman in 2 Kings 5, etc.) due to their connection to Israelites. God offered promises of blessing to other nations in relationship to God’s self (Isaiah 19:25; Jeremiah 48:47).  Second, the Law God

Second, the Law God gave to Israel was to be applied to everyone, native-born and foreigners. God displayed His acceptance of all humans equally by having the Law applied to everyone, in the same manner (Exodus 12:17–19; Leviticus 17:10–15; Numbers 15:27–31).

[29] Elements of Biblical Justice  A significant consideration in the Assemblies of God’s opposition to racism is that racism violates the concept of biblical justice. Justice is a biblical theme that is developed from an understanding of the nature of God, who himself is just and righteous (Deuteronomy 10:18; 32:4; Job 37:23; Psalm 9:7; 10:17–18; 33:4–5; Isaiah 5:16; 30:18; Hosea 12:6). As the holy and just Sovereign of the creation, God expects justice (Micah 6:8). Consequently, when we act unjustly, whether with respect to race or any other personal characteristic, we go against the divine nature and order.    A foundational element of biblical justice is the understanding that God intended for human beings to be a community from the beginning (Genesis 1:27). Human beings are bound together by far more commonalities than what may distinguish them from one another. Every member of the community shares the threats and injuries against other members. In the same way, the successes are

[30] by far more commonalities than what may distinguish them from one another. Every member of the community shares the threats and injuries against other members. In the same way, the successes are shared. This demands that each person in the community assume care and responsibilities for all others in the community. It is far too easy to lose the sense of community as populations grow, but biblical justice begins with this understanding.  In biblical justice, there is a place for identifying with the sins of the larger community and calling out in confession for forgiveness (Nehemiah 1:1–11; Daniel 9:1–19). For both Nehemiah and Daniel, there was a release of God’s intervention when they prayed, confessing the sins of the people. They wanted God to express His forgiveness to the community.   Additionally, biblical justice recognizes that people have individual responsibility before God. For example, both Jeremiah and Ezekiel warned Israel explicitly that they could not merely blame

[31] Additionally, biblical justice recognizes that people have individual responsibility before God. For example, both Jeremiah and Ezekiel warned Israel explicitly that they could not merely blame their sin on the larger community (Jeremiah 31:29–30; Ezekiel 18:1–4). The community at large needs to repent, asking for the forgiveness of God for all forms of injustice and the failure to speak against it. However, individuals cannot escape their personal need to do the same.  The Scriptures are clear that racism must not only be addressed on an individual basis, but also corporately, whether in the church or the world. For example, the institutional understanding of the relationship between lender and borrower would allow the lender to charge interest and to receive a pledge for the loan. However, this system could be oppressive, so the Lord provided relief for those who would be harmed by the institution (Exodus 22:25–27). The prophet Jeremiah warns against those who use the system to

[32] this system could be oppressive, so the Lord provided relief for those who would be harmed by the institution (Exodus 22:25–27). The prophet Jeremiah warns against those who use the system to harm others: “Woe to him who builds his palace by unrighteousness, his upper rooms by injustice, making his own people work for nothing, not paying them for their labor” (Jeremiah 22:13). In the New Testament, James similarly warns those he identifies as rich for failing to honor laborers for their labor (James 5:1–6).  The moral and ethical principles behind these Scriptural commands necessitate equal opportunity not only in lending institutions or compensation but should also apply to other practices and processes. As individuals and as a church we should oppose any practice or process that results in unfair or harmful treatment of individuals because of race.  Biblical justice calls for people to be concerned for those who are oppressed. Isaiah’s message noted the sinful condition of Israel

[33] in unfair or harmful treatment of individuals because of race.  Biblical justice calls for people to be concerned for those who are oppressed. Isaiah’s message noted the sinful condition of Israel and urged them to repent. As part of the change that repentance would bring them, he noted they should “defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow” (Isaiah 1:17). The Psalmist pronounced a blessing on those who “have regard for the weak” (Psalm 41:1). The writer of Proverbs offered an additional challenge for readers to “speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy” (Proverbs 31:8–9).

[34] The description of biblical justice provided in the foregoing provides the basis of a thorough critique of racism, a critique so penetrating that the only label fitting for such beliefs and actions is sin. Racism goes against God’s nature and order. Racism violates community. Racism is both an individual and corporate attack on justice that Christians must seriously address. Racism undermines the deeply Christian virtue of concern for those who are oppressed.  Summary Racism, acknowledged or ignored, is part of the present world situation. As believers, we have an opportunity to be salt and light as Spirit-empowered witnesses. The following are suggestions for ministers and members.  First, as noted in the 1989 resolution on racism, “we call any and all to repentance who have participated in the sin of racism through personal thought or action, or through church and social structures, or through inactivity in addressing racism as individuals or as a church.”3 The Church, collectively

[35] in the sin of racism through personal thought or action, or through church and social structures, or through inactivity in addressing racism as individuals or as a church.”3 The Church, collectively and individually, must repent of the sin of racism expressed, in both attitudes and behavior. Racism harms others who bear the image of God. Where the members or churches in the AG community are guilty of racism, repentance and turning away from such is a needful first step.   Second, the Church must acknowledge the image of God in all people and live out teachings about the equality of people in the Bible. God created humanity with diversity and affirming that diversity goes hand in hand with affirming human equality. Furthermore, the cross of Jesus testifies to and provides for ultimate reconciliation, not only of people with God but also of human to human. Barriers, hatreds, suspicions, unequal treatment, and the like have been healed by the shedding of His blood (Galatians 3:28;

[36] reconciliation, not only of people with God but also of human to human. Barriers, hatreds, suspicions, unequal treatment, and the like have been healed by the shedding of His blood (Galatians 3:28; Ephesians 2:14). We are new creatures, showing the world what God’s love looks like and evidencing that love in every circumstance with all people. The Church must live out in actuality what Christ provided for in His atonement and must demonstrate this truth in a fallen and divided world.  Third, the Church needs to model the inclusiveness of the body of Christ. The eradication of racism demands including others in the circles of ministry and leadership.4 To exclude fellow believers from leadership because of race is incompatible with seeing all humans as God’s creations in whom He has placed great value and for whom Christ died. A broad diversity, in all the ways that we are legitimately diverse, must become a part of our thinking and planning for the full expression and plan of God to be

[37] value and for whom Christ died. A broad diversity, in all the ways that we are legitimately diverse, must become a part of our thinking and planning for the full expression and plan of God to be revealed.  Finally, the Church must recognize and decry racism in all of its forms. Not every human system is, by definition, racist. However, any human system can limit opportunities for others based on race and prevent them from advancing in society. When those are noted, the Church should not be silent; it should demand change with humility and grace.

[39] any kind of musical instrument.   In fact, Revelation depicts repeated scenes of heavenly worship featuring musical instruments and songs, as well as verbal celebration of the glory and power of God. The worshipping throng of Revelation 5, some with harp in hand, climaxed their songs to God and the Lamb with “praise and honor and glory and power, forever and ever!” (Revelation 5:13). The 144,000 sang to the Lamb “a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders” (Revelation 14:3). Those who overcame the beast “held harps given them by God and sang the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb: ‘Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty’ ”

Humans are to worship and serve Him as the Creator (Isaiah 40:26,28,31).  They are warned not to strive against their Maker (Isaiah 45:9).  They are to commit the keeping of their souls to Him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator (1 Peter 4:19).  They are also to recognize that their help comes from the One who made the heavens and the earth (Psalms 121:2; 124:8; 146:5–6), and in effecting His eternal purposes, there is nothing too hard for Him (Jeremiah 32:17).  A Work of the Trinity  The Bible also teaches that creation was a cooperative work of the Trinity.  In addition to naming God [the Father] as Creator, the Old Testament shows that “the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters” (Genesis 1:2; Psalm 33:6–7).  The New Testament further reveals that Jesus [the Son], who is the one Mediator between God and fallen

[41] to be God” (2 Thessalonians 2:4). Of this same time, John in the Revelation observed, “Men worshiped (proskyneō) the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped (proskyneō) the beast and asked, ‘Who is like the beast? Who can make war against him?’ ” (13:4; cf. vv.8,12). Even after the Great Tribulation judgments of the seals and trumpets, surviving humans “did not stop worshiping (proskyneō) demons, and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone and wood—idols that cannot see or hear or walk” (Revelation 9:20).  Worship As Lifestyle  While the focus of this paper is on the nature of worship in the gathered Christian community, worship is to be much more pervasive. The Samaritan woman to whom Jesus spoke was fixated on places of worship. Jesus told her the time would come when neither                                                 6See Raymond E.

[42] together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).
14. THE MILLENNIAL REIGN OF CHRIST
The second coming of Christ includes the rapture of the saints, which is our 
blessed hope, followed by the visible return of Christ with His saints to reign on 
the earth for one thousand years (Zechariah 14:5; Matthew 24:27,30; Revelation 1:7; 
19:11–14; 20:1–6). This millennial reign will bring the salvation of national Israel (Eze-
kiel 37:21,22; Zephaniah 3:19,20; Romans 11:26,27) and the establishment of univer-
sal peace (Isaiah 11:6–9; Psalm 72:3–8; Micah 4:3,4).
15. THE FINAL JUDGMENT
There will be a fi  nal judgment in which the wicked dead will be raised and judged 
according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to

when we shall be unable to change the past or to do those things which we have 
left undone.” 
With a much larger chart stretched across the platform of a church—thirty 
feet long and in full color—John G. Hall from Newcastle, Oklahoma, taught on 
“The Eternal Program of God of the Ages and Dispensations.” For believers in the 
pew, the chart projected the entire sweep of redemption from the dispensation of 
innocence in the Garden of Eden to the Great White Throne Judgment as depicted 
in the Book of Revelation, followed by the new heaven and the new earth. Other 
evangelists drew chalk drawings while they preached, often a scene of Christ’s 
second coming.
The persons introduced in this chapter creatively used their talents, and as 
a result, “the word of God grew and multiplied” (Acts 12:24, KJV). C. M. Ward

🧠 Query: What is the Assemblies of God?

ithin a few weeks of the organizational meeting of the Assemblies of God in 
Hot Springs, Arkansas, the Christian Evangel carried an article entitled “The 
Assembly of God,” which defi  nes the term as “an assembly, called by God, 
and belonging to God.” It should be the “light and salt of the earth, . . . a dwelling in 
which God lives by his Spirit,” and led according to the will of God by “certain men 
(and women) who are specially chosen to act for the assembly in discharging various 
parts of its service.” 
The emphasis on the presence and manifestations of the Spirit’s gifts set an 
Assemblies of God church apart from an evangelical church. “I want to say that an 
ideal Pentecostal church is not only comprised of born-again believers, is not only a 
holiness church, and not only a church that believes in and enjoys the Baptism of the 
Holy Ghost, but an ideal Pentecostal church is a demonstrative church,” remarked A.

[2] Because the Assemblies of God has grown rapidly both at home and abroad and 
has continued to experience the blessing of God as it has sought to do His will and to 
be an instrument of divine purpose; and
Because the Assemblies of God determines to remain a body of believers respond-

als since the 1980s. “Cautious embrace” of fresh experiences and ideas has been the 
hallmark of a Fellowship that respects its distinctive ideas while working in fraternal 
partnership with evangelical and Pentecostal believers across the nation and around 
the world. Assemblies of God leaders such as Cecil M. “Mel” Robeck, Frank Macchia, 
and the late Gary B. McGee have engaged in dialogue with Roman Catholic, Eastern 
Orthodox, and Protestant groups, with salutary reductions in misunderstanding and 
increased cooperation where possible.  
The Assemblies of God was part of the 1943 founding of the National Association 
of Evangelicals as well as an active leader in the Lausanne Movement. Some Pente-
costals see this as compromise and long for greater separation of Pentecostal and 
evangelical. What the separatists forget is that the global evangelical families of faith

the organ for a church cantata, which required him to 
memorize all of the songs.)
In the postwar period and especially after 1960, a 
number of congregations grew to megachurch status, 
with fl  eets of buses scurrying through communities to 
bring visitors and the faithful to church. A strong leader 
pastored each one, a charismatic fi  gure capable of 
inspiring people to work together in evangelism. The 
stories of their growth and methods increasingly set 
the pattern for success in the denomination. In many 
respects, they resembled Baptist megachurches that 
developed at the same time. 
It is signifi  cant that early Pentecostal church 
growth had depended on preaching accompanied 
by signs and wonders, usually miracles of healing, to 
attract the unsaved. Assemblies of God churches now 
added attractive programs appealing to the entire family. Obviously, the times were 
changing.

[5] Anna Lock, as well as lesser-known fi  gures like Naomi Blaylock, Pauline Sawyer, and 
Norma Elliott became invisible to the next generation. 
When the General Council met in 1963 to hear the report and recommendations, 
the committee affi  rmed that “prior to any Pentecostal organization, God indicated 
that evangelism is the whole work of the whole church, and Holy-Ghost-fi lled people 
[are] the evangelistic agency of God. True spirituality and evangelism are insepara-
ble.”
35 Furthermore, the great achievement of the Day of Pentecost was not speaking 
in tongues, but the three thousand people who became believers. Therefore, fi nancial 
gains or new buildings could not measure advancement. “Success in the spiritual 
realm is determined by the souls set free from the power of Satan.”

In response to the committee’s report, the Council resolved to make evangelism 
the top priority for every department at the headquarters and assigned this respon-
sibility to the general superintendent. Two years later, the Council abolished the 
Department of Evangelism and replaced it with the Spiritual Life–Evangelism Com-
mission. Two initiatives became especially popular and have made signifi cant contri-
butions to home and foreign missions: Mobilization and Placement Service (MAPS) 
and Ambassadors in Mission (AIM). 
The larger of the two programs, MAPS had actually begun in 1964 and was 
designed “to ascertain areas of need and opportunity in the United States for . .  . 
individuals who can assist districts, churches, and institutions on a short term, tem-
porary, or permanent basis.”

short-term missions work (two years or less).
This new door of ministry for laypersons in the Assemblies of God afforded col-
lege students, retirees, business and professional people, teachers, technicians, 
offi ce workers, and other adults opportunities to work in 
home missions, including Native American ministries, 
literature and media ministries, and building construc-
tion. Foreign missions opportunities embraced, among 
others, offi  ce work, media ministries, printing and pub-
lications, and construction. Specifi  cally, MAPS hoped to 
maximize the participation of the laity “in ministry and 
evangelism, church planting, and strengthening existing 
congregations.”

[9] PEOPLE OF THE SPIRIT
The call for intensifi  ed spiritual and evangelistic vitality in the ranks also 
prompted two new publications. Advance (later replaced by Enrichment Journal) func-
tioned to serve ministers with promotional materials and information on denomina-
tional programs. In addition, the Council launched Paraclete, a journal containing arti-
cles and book reviews focusing exclusively on the person and work of the Holy Spirit.
COUNCIL ON EVANGELISM
The need for an in-depth self-study of the General Council and its headquarters 
operation led the Executive Presbytery in 1967 to set up the Committee on Advance. 
Its assignment was to analyze reasons for the downturn in growth and develop a fi ve-
year plan of advance. As part of the study, a specially called Council on Evangelism 
met on August 26–29, 1968, in St. Louis, Missouri, to articulate the world mission of 
the Assemblies of God. It attracted some seven thousand ministers and laypersons.

[10] met on August 26–29, 1968, in St. Louis, Missouri, to articulate the world mission of 
the Assemblies of God. It attracted some seven thousand ministers and laypersons.
In the keynote address, “The Mission of the Church,” Thomas F. Zimmerman 
charged them to fulfi  ll the threefold task of the church: ministry to the Lord, to other 
believers, and to the world. The last point placed heavy emphasis on winning the lost 
to Christ. Although he lauded the heritage of the Assemblies of God, Zimmerman 
counseled, “Let us never get the idea that God has brought us to our present plateau 
to terminate progress—His command is, ‘Go forward.’”
40
At the conclusion of the meeting, the Council issued the “Declaration of St. Louis,” 
representing the work of the Committee on Advance. Noting that the Assemblies of 
God was brought into being by the Spirit “as an instrument of divine purpose in these 
end times,” it stated (1) God’s purposes for humankind, (2) the triune mission of the

[11] God was brought into being by the Spirit “as an instrument of divine purpose in these 
end times,” it stated (1) God’s purposes for humankind, (2) the triune mission of the 
Church, and (3) the importance of strongly encouraging believers to be baptized in 
the Holy Spirit. Only Spirit baptism would enable them to evangelize accompanied 
by supernatural signs as in the Book of Acts, worship in the fullness of the Spirit, and 
respond to the “full working” of the Spirit in building the body of Christ.
41
To those in attendance, compromise on the last point could only weaken spiri-
tual energy; Spirit baptism as an entry to the deeper work of the Spirit had to remain 
a cardinal teaching if revival and evangelization were to happen. Although Donald 
Gee had died two years earlier, those present would have shared his sentiments: “To 
surrender [baptism in the Spirit] would be to surrender a sacred trust from the Most

[12] Gee had died two years earlier, those present would have shared his sentiments: “To 
surrender [baptism in the Spirit] would be to surrender a sacred trust from the Most 
High and renounce a testimony of great value even to those who reject it. The Pente-
costal revival performs its true function within the whole Body of Christ while it keeps 
unimpaired its own distinctive testimony. The Church needs a Pentecostal revival.”
42 
The Council, therefore, appealed to its spiritual heritage as the key to fulfi  lling its 
divine calling. 
Although the papers read at the Council on Evangelism were published in Our 
Mission in Today’s World (1968), they basically restated priorities in place since 1914. 
In Cyril Homer’s address, “The Ministry of the Church to the World,” he voiced the 
opinions of Anglo-Pentecostals, conservative evangelicals, and fundamentalists alike 
in regard to the Church’s involvement in society: “The great danger of this church

generation,” he insisted, “is that it can become so busy with the social and material-
istic problems it neglects the one great work committed to it.” 
For the largely white and upwardly mobile constituency of the Assemblies of 
God, nothing more needed to be said about church and society. After all, Homer 
noted, “a man’s soul is infi  nitely more important than his body. It is a simple fact that 
once a man’s soul is in right relationship with God, divine provision is made for body, 
soul, and spirit.”
43
At the same time the Council met, however, Ameri-
ca’s major cities were seething with racial discontent; 
in fact, some were burning. The great leader of the civil 
rights movement in America, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 
had been shot dead that spring. The Vietnam War, then 
at its height, was ripping through the fabric of American 
society. In 1965, the General Council had passed a res-

[15] at its height, was ripping through the fabric of American 
society. In 1965, the General Council had passed a res-
olution favoring civil rights and condemning any kind of 
discrimination. Yet no agency within the denomination 
was added to work toward those ends. White Pentecostals 
rarely became involved in any prophetic witness against 
the injustices of the prevailing culture (e.g., racism, pov-
erty).
44 Twenty-fi  ve years would pass before white and 
black Pentecostals themselves would begin the painful 
process of repentance and reconciliation.
Despite such shortcomings, the Council on Evange-
lism had successfully clarifi  ed the mission of the Assem-
blies of God. It assured the faithful that the denomination 
had remained committed to its original vision of evangelizing the world in the last 
days. Kansas District Superintendent Paul Lowenberg summed it up best in his eve-
ning address entitled “The Mandate of the Church”: “The end is in sight. We must

[16] days. Kansas District Superintendent Paul Lowenberg summed it up best in his eve-
ning address entitled “The Mandate of the Church”: “The end is in sight. We must 
redouble our efforts; we must renew our consecration; we must revive our zeal; we 
must hasten the return of our Lord. Every sign points to His soon coming,” he charged 
the delegates. 
45 
From the crisis over the Latter Rain to the Council on Evangelism, major chal-
lenges confronted the Assemblies of God. Committed to using all possible means 
to win the world for Christ, new and more effective programs were started. Council 
leaders also cooperated with the various agencies of the National Association 
of Evangelicals, including the National Sunday School Association, Evangeli-
cal Foreign Missions Association (present-day Evangelical Fellowship of Mission 
Agencies), National Religious Broadcasters, and Accrediting Association of Bible 
Colleges.

Agencies), National Religious Broadcasters, and Accrediting Association of Bible

After World War II, the living standard of the faithful improved. As this took place, 
questions arose about the role of the Christian in society, the meaning of holiness, 
and the very nature of Pentecostal spirituality itself.
 A respected longtime pastor and 
educator in the General Coun-
cil, Cyril Homer served in many 
capacities including the presi-
dencies of South-Eastern Bible 
College and North Central Bible 
College.

and tongues. There is a real danger, in the words of Earl Creps, 
of a generation of Assemblies of God “post-Pentecostal Pen-
tecostals” that affi  rm the Statement of Fundamental Truths 
and enjoy relationships, but do not seek to practice or pro-
mote Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues.
General Superintendent Wood disputes this pessimistic 
picture in a 2014 centennial interview in Charisma magazine. 
His observations, interviews with leaders, and wide travel 
affi rm that Spirit baptism with the initial physical evidence of 
tongues is alive and growing. He affi  rmed that the statistics 
are imperfect, not refl  ecting practices in thousands of churches in recent years.

[31] notes a signifi cant rise in Pentecostal practices, even among those not tradition-
ally labeled Pentecostal or charismatic. For much the evangelical world in particular, 
praying for healing and miracles, exercising spiritual gifts, trusting the Lord for deliv-
erance, and speaking in tongues are all valid biblical practices. This is a signifi  cant 
change within one generation. 
Cessationism (the belief that the manifestations of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians 
12–14 ceased with the death of the original apostles or the close of the New Testa-
ment canon in the fourth century) is a declining movement as believers of all denom-
inations and theological persuasions affi  rm the contemporary work of the Spirit. 
Though many of these groups do not share the “classical” Pentecostal distinctive 
of tongues as the initial physical evident of Spirit baptism, the affi  rmation that the 
Spirit works in and through all the gifts is a heartening change.

Spirit works in and through all the gifts is a heartening change. 
There are some signs across the United States that cause concern among 
thoughtful persons. The number of people that answered “none” when asked for reli-
gious affi  liation has grown from a miniscule percentage in the 1980s to 16.1  per-
cent in a 2007 poll by Pew Research. And 28 percent have left the faith they were 
raised in or affi  liate with no religion at all.
1 This refl  ects two trends: (1) the loss of 
denominational loyalty among some that might still (vaguely) identify themselves as 
Christians; and (2) an increasing number of the U.S. population (both immigrant and 
native-born) with no religious affi liation.

[33] “Post-Christian” and “postmodern” are labels tossed about with great frequency 
in popular analysis. The United States remains much more religious than most of 
Western Europe; however, “being spiritual and not religious” is gaining as a category 
of a generation without signifi  cant exposure to the gospel. 
The new challenge for Assemblies of God leaders is evangelization of people with 
no Christian memory. This is a new phenomenon for many U.S. leaders (though not 
for the appointed missionaries of AGWM). 
Another concern among thoughtful adherents is moral compromise with the 
subversion of traditional marriage and sexuality in the last half-century. The public

consensus in the West and the United States of lifelong heterosexual marriage and 
celibacy for singles is no longer the prevailing opinion of popular culture or even 
a majority of people. While strong elements within American society advocate or 
support gay marriage, the Assemblies of God stands fi  rmly committed to scriptural 
teaching that marriage is between a man and a woman.
When confronted by actual or potential compromise in other evangelical or Pen-
tecostal fellowships and organizations, steadfast adherence to biblical marriage is 
quickly affi  rmed. The Assemblies of God leadership has been uncompromising it its 
standards of sexual conduct while affi  rming love for all people broken by sin.

[35] OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD!
The evangelical revivals of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries fueled the 
birth of global missions. The Pentecostal awakenings have accelerated the spread 
of the gospel in the twentieth century. We are now witnesses the re-evangelizing of 
Europe and the United States by missional believers from developing nations. The 
gospel is now going from everywhere to everywhere as former missions fi elds become 
missions-sending agencies. 
When Melvin Hodges penned The Indigenous Church in 1953, the aim of missions was 
a self-sustaining local church and, in the long-term, a self-sustaining national fellow-
ship. These remain important goals; however, a more complete goal is emerging in the 
twenty-fi rst century: establishing churches and fellowships of churches that become 
not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around

[36] not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around 
the world answer the Great Commission call and become “360  Churches.” Mission-
ary-scholars such as Alan Johnson in Thailand are now articulating an integration of 
apostolic pioneering and church planting united with holistic care for communities. 
In the post-Christian West, Pentecostal spirituality and theology are the answer 
for generations that are hungry for experience and meaning rooted in love and truth. 
Apologetics and careful explanations of truth must be united with the proclamation 
of the Cross and power of the Spirit to deliver, heal, forgive, redeem, and transform.

[37] Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The 
signs and wonders demonstrated in Scripture are alive and well on the frontiers of 
evangelization and missions today. The Assemblies of God has a bright future as we 
recognize those frontiers across the street and around the world.
Gary McGee’s fi nal work, Miracles, Missions and American Pentecostalism (2010), details 
the supernatural confi rmation of the missionary pioneers. As a new Spirit-empowered 
generation hears the call to evangelism, worship, discipleship, and compassion, they 
can expect the Lord of the harvest to again confi  rm the message of grace.

the years, refl  ecting the ongoing expectancy of supernatural manifestations of power 
in the churches.
The ministry of Hispanic evangelist José Rojas also illustrates the anticipation of 
the Spirit’s power. Since he had not attended a Bible school, his preaching was lim-
ited to his testimony about his own personal conversion out of a life of wickedness. 
During revivals he would spend most of the nights in prayer. When the time came to 
preach, he began by singing a Spanish chorus “Dios te ve.” (“God sees you.”) In many 
of his services, he never got further than the song because people would begin to 
feel remorse for their sinful lives and make their way to the altar to repent. Hundreds 
came to Christ in this fashion. Rojas became so well known for singing this song that 
many people knew him only by the name “Dios te ve.”
Churches generally exhibited a high level of audience involvement through

[44] many people knew him only by the name “Dios te ve.”
Churches generally exhibited a high level of audience involvement through 
song, choirs, vocal and instrumental ensembles, expressive worship (clapping, 
raising hands, shouting the praises of God, and, occasionally, dancing), testi-
mony, and the gifts of the Spirit. Exuberant singing marked the services, some-
times with people in the congregation taking the liberty to lead out in a favorite 
song at an appropriate time in the service when they felt the Spirit prompt them. 
Otherwise, the song leader—usually the key worship leader next to the pastor—
selected the songs. Still the features of Pentecostal worship varied across the 
country due to cultural differences, ranging from lively Southern-style worship 
to more staid worship to the exuberant services of the Hispanic churches. (An 
Assembly of God without a pianist or guitarist, however, presented no small chal-
lenge to a worship leader.)

t was not unusual for the altar services on Sunday evening [at First Assembly] to last 
at least several hours. No one seemed anxious to leave the presence of the Lord. Men 
and women would stand, sit, or lie slain in the Spirit, worshipping God. A symphony of 
praise would rise and fall in tides. After I had ﬁ  nished praying, I turned in my seat and 
quietly worshipped with my eyes open. There were people slain in the Spirit all over 
the altar area. A woman at the far left of the altar area began gracefully dancing in the 
Spirit. She had her eyes shut and her hands were lifted high to the Lord. She began 
moving slowly across the altar area and my ﬁ  rst thought was, Oh, no, she is going to step

on someone’s hand or foot…or even worse yet, trip over someone and land right on them! In total 
amazement, I watched her gracefully dance all over the altar area from one end to the 
other without ever touching a hand, foot, or body. I knew that what I was seeing was 
totally impossible for a human being to do…a supernatural dance was being performed 
before my very eyes. Even though I was only in my early teens, I will never forget that 
supernatural performance.

[47] Perhaps refl ecting the infl  uence of the Salvation Army on early Pentecostals, 
churches often had orchestras; consequently, many young people became skilled 
musicians. Aimee Semple McPherson’s Angelus Temple in Los Angeles, California, 
sported a large “Silver Band.” 
Most orchestras, however, were 
much smaller.
The musicians at Bethel 
Temple Assembly of God in 
Canton, Ohio, had a ministry 
both within and far beyond the 
walls of the church sanctuary. 
Bob Vance, a steelworker and 
elder in the church, served as 
the director and played the 
guitar. Velma McGee was the 
equivalent of fi  rst violinist, 
assisted by the church custodian, Ed Jensen, and Gene Kulik. Kermit Snyder, an elder, 
played the drums. David McNeilly and his son played trumpets, Gary McGee made 
sounds on the baritone horn, and several other youths played clarinets. George Hartzell

[48] sounds on the baritone horn, and several other youths played clarinets. George Hartzell 
strummed the bass fi  ddle, and Lucille Kempthorn played the piano. They ministered 
in Sunday evening services and traveled several times a year in the surrounding area 
to church dedications and revivals and to hold services at nursing homes and county 
homes. This lay-driven ministry exemplifi  ed similar efforts across the country.
Unique to Pentecostal churches, the vocal utterances of the Holy Spirit (gifts of 
tongues, interpretation, and prophecy) played an important role in worship. Sover-
eignly distributed like the rest of the nine gifts (1 Corinthians 12:7–11), Pentecostals 
viewed their manifestation as indispensable to Spirit-fi  lled worship. However, it was 
clearly understood that Paul’s instructions about the exercise of these gifts (1 Cor-
inthians 14) had to be followed to insure that the work of the Spirit would not be

[49] clearly understood that Paul’s instructions about the exercise of these gifts (1 Cor-
inthians 14) had to be followed to insure that the work of the Spirit would not be 
jeopardized by poor judgment. At the Council on Spiritual Life in Minneapolis in 
1972, California pastor Dwight H. McLaughlin cautioned, “The gifts of the Spirit must 
be balanced by the fruit of the Spirit. Speaking in tongues, the gift of prophecy, all 
knowledge, all faith, even though seeming to help others, will not profi  t their users 
without love (1 Corinthians 13:1–3).”
The vision, dynamism, and growth of Pentecostal churches have been determined 
to a great degree by the pastor, aided by committed church workers. Assemblies of 
God congregations have always expected much from their pastors: They should be

[51] real reason could be the lack of spiritual vitality in the church, since “when God sends 
revival all wish to be near the front to participate in the service.”
The persons introduced in this chapter all attained success, but of various kinds. 
Among the best-known church administrators, James Hamill pastored First Assem-
bly of God in Memphis, Tennessee, for thirty-seven years and watched it grow from 
ninety-nine to twenty-eight hundred members. Tommy Barnett left the evangelistic 
fi eld to pastor Westside Assembly in Davenport, Iowa, and spearheaded its dramatic 
growth through soul-winning and dazzling promotion. Among Native Americans, 
Navajo artist Charlie Lee became the fi rst appointed national home missionary and 
pioneered the Assembly of God in Shiprock, New Mexico.

Trinity Assembly of God in Baltimore, Maryland, became a pillar congregation on the 
East Coast. And different yet again, Daena Cargnel shepherded small congregations

Georgia pastor Edgar Bethany remarked: “Nobody is complete without eyes 
for vision, ears for hearing, nose for discerning of pleasant or foul odors, mouth 
for expression and communication, arms and feet for erect locomotion.” Indeed, 
“every member is needed in the Body of Christ.” Voicing the same concern, evange-
list Gladys Pearson admitted, “There is a great burden on the hearts of evangelists 
today—we need help from among the lay members. For evangelists to assume the 
whole responsibility of winning souls is impossible. Each person has a sphere of 
infl uence that no other reaches. He is therefore responsible before God for the souls 
within that sphere.” Thus, congregations could not have grown without the work of

Melvin Pridemore, Mrs. Venezia, and Michael Cardone, all laypersons mentioned in 
this chapter. 
JAMES HAMILL
(1913–1994)
In his long ministry at First Assembly in Memphis, James Hamill became a virtual 
institution in the city, widely known among religious and civic leaders. Like other 
Pentecostal pioneers who reached success after years of labor, he grew up in hard 
times. His father, a timber contractor in Pughs Mill, Mississippi, died when Hamill 
was six years old. Although the family had been unchurched, he was converted and 
called to the ministry at age seventeen. Without the benefi  t of either formal training 
or spiritual heritage, he began preaching two years later and pastored churches in

[54] called to the ministry at age seventeen. Without the benefi  t of either formal training 
or spiritual heritage, he began preaching two years later and pastored churches in 
Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Mississippi be fore moving to Tennessee.
It took a strong individual to hurdle what Hamill encountered in his ministry. 
In his fi  rst year as an evangelist, his income was $172. The next year, $258. He was 
philosophical: “Poor preach, poor pay. If I ever learn to preach, maybe they’ll pay me.”
At thirty-one he accepted an invitation to pastor First Assembly and moved to 
Memphis with his wife, Katheryne. “The church was poorly located, small . . . and

discouraged,” he later wrote. “But God laid that congregation and city on my heart. 
And I  obeyed.” In the succeeding years (World War  II had just ended), he led the 
church into six building programs and founded a Christian school along with other 
ministries. 
Related to the growth of the church, Hamill held a strong, virtually patriarchal 
view of the pastor’s authority. In his estimation, serious problems arose when a con-
gregation suffered from poor leader-
ship. Instead, “the successful pastor 
must lead with authority. To exercise 
[it] does not mean to dictate, to be 
a tyrant. It means rather to lead and 
guide in one’s work with individ-
uals, committees, boards, as well 
as with the congregation.” He also 
taught tithing and believed that each 
member of the congregation should 
pledge an annual amount of money 
to fi  nance the church budget. When 
he retired in 1981, the budget had 
reached two million dollars.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📄 Context Sent to Model:
[1] C. With Regard to Sexual Identity  The Assemblies of God believes that God created humankind in His image:  male (man) and female (woman), sexually different but with equal personal dignity.  The Fellowship supports the dignity of individual persons affirming their biological sex and discouraging any and all attempts to physically change, alter, or disagree with their predominant biological sex—including but not limited to elective sex-reassignment, transvestite, transgender, or nonbinary “genderqueer” acts or conduct. (Genesis 1:26–28; Romans 1:26–32; 1 Corinthians 6:9–11).  D. With Regard to Sexual Orientation  The Assemblies of God affirms the sexual complementarity of man and woman and teaches that any and all same-sex sexual attractions are to be resisted. Consequently, believers are to refrain from any and all same-sex sexual acts or conduct, which are intrinsically disordered.

The Bible as Final Authority 
 
The history and practice of the Assemblies of God show  that God blesses the public 
ministry of women. Yet, debate continues about  the proper role of women in spiritual 
leadership. Since the Bible is our final authority in all matters of faith and practice, we 
must ensure that our stance is founded on Scripture.  What the Bible says should be 
explored as carefully and objectively as possible, using established rules of exegesis and 
interpretation. This paper gives both historical and theological guidance. It also evaluates 
the usual texts used to limit or deny the ministry of women.  
 
Exploring a text ’s original culture and context  is needed to grasp its meaning. For 
instance, 1 Corinthians 7:1 starts with “ Now regarding the questions you asked in your

W
ithin a few weeks of the organizational meeting of the Assemblies of God in 
Hot Springs, Arkansas, the Christian Evangel carried an article entitled “The 
Assembly of God,” which defi  nes the term as “an assembly, called by God, 
and belonging to God.” It should be the “light and salt of the earth, . . . a dwelling in 
which God lives by his Spirit,” and led according to the will of God by “certain men 
(and women) who are specially chosen to act for the assembly in discharging various 
parts of its service.” 
The emphasis on the presence and manifestations of the Spirit’s gifts set an 
Assemblies of God church apart from an evangelical church. “I want to say that an 
ideal Pentecostal church is not only comprised of born-again believers, is not only a 
holiness church, and not only a church that believes in and enjoys the Baptism of the 
Holy Ghost, but an ideal Pentecostal church is a demonstrative church,” remarked A.

letter.” That phrase, “ now regarding,” was repeated by Paul as he answer ed questions 
the Corinthians asked. First Corinthians holds some of Paul’s answers, but it only reveals 
fragments of the Corinthians’ questions. A deeper study of the letter will reconstruct the 
questions they asked.  
 
For Paul’s letters to Timothy, the situation in Ephesus must be understood. Acts 19:8–41 
is one key to understanding. It reveals that magic and the worship of Artemis are parts of 
that situation. Also, Paul told the men in Ephesus to stop arguing during prayer (1 Timothy 
2:8). The Bible includes no other account of Paul giving similar instructions. This was 
likely a problem specific to the Ephesian church . The task of grasping the meaning of  
Scripture requires careful discernment. The reader must discern  between timeless 
theological principles and advice meant for an audience in their unique context.

[6] theological principles and advice meant for an audience in their unique context. 
 
Some Christian groups disagree  on how certain passages of Scripture should be 
interpreted. This has led some to deny what Pentecostalism affirms about women in 
ministry leadership. Charity is called for  toward traditions that may disagree with our 
findings. We also recognize that  concessions have been made to plant churches in 
strongly patriarchal contexts. 
 
Biblical Examples of Women in Ministerial Leadership 
 
The Old Testament records strong female leadership through several s triking examples. 
Miriam was a prophet  and worship leader  to Israel during the Exodus alongside her 
brothers, Moses and Aaron (Exodus 15:20; Micah 6:4). Deborah, a prophet and a judge, 
directed Barak to lead the army  into combat against Israel ’s oppressors (Judges 4– 5). 
Huldah, a prophet, verified  the scroll of the Law found in the temple. She  helped spark

[7] directed Barak to lead the army  into combat against Israel ’s oppressors (Judges 4– 5). 
Huldah, a prophet, verified  the scroll of the Law found in the temple. She  helped spark 
religious reform in the days of Josiah (2 Kings 22:14–20; 2 Chronicles 34:22–28). 
 
Ministry in the New Testament is charismatic  in nature. That means it is made possible 
as the Holy Spirit distributes spiritual gifts ( charismata) as He chooses to each member 
of the body of Christ (Romans 12:6–8; 1 Corinthians 12:7–11, 27–28; Ephesians 4:7–12; 
1 Peter 4:10–11). Some gifts are a spontaneous work of the Spirit. Others are recognized 
ministry gifts to the Body . The Spirit gives a ll the gifts for service without regard to sex . 
For example, the gift of prophecy is explicitly for both men and women: “ ‘Your sons and 
your daughters will prophesy ’ “ (Acts 2:17). The New Testament confirms that women 
received and exercised this gift of the Spirit (Acts 21:9; 1 Corinthians 11:5).

[8] your daughters will prophesy ’ “ (Acts 2:17). The New Testament confirms that women 
received and exercised this gift of the Spirit (Acts 21:9; 1 Corinthians 11:5). 
 
Women engaged in  ministry and proclamation even before the Day of Pentecost . A 
Samaritan woman introduced her town to Jesus. Many from the woman’s town “believed 
in him because of the woman’s testimony” (John 4:39, NIV
2). Women were also the first

witnesses of the resurrection of Christ. They were instructed to share this great news with 
the disciples (Matthew 28:1–8). 
 
The New Testament shows that women filled important ministry roles after the Day of 
Pentecost as well. Tabitha (Dorcas) started a benevolence ministry (Acts 9:36). One of 
the early house churches met at the home of Lydia (Acts 16:14– 15, 40). Her home also 
seems to have become a base for the Philippian church.  
 
A number of women are named as ministry colleagues.  Paul named two women in 
Philippi, Euodia and Syntyche, as women who “ have contended at my side in the cause 
of the gospel” (Philippians 4:2–3, NIV). In Romans 16, Paul greeted both male and female 
ministry colleagues using the word kopiaō. This term noted the “work” or “labor” of Mary, 
Tryphena, Tryphosa, and Persis (Romans 16:6, 12). Elsewhere, Paul uses kopiaō for the 
labor of ministry (1 Corinthians 16:16; 1 Thessalonians 5:12; 1 Timothy 5:17).

[10] Tryphena, Tryphosa, and Persis (Romans 16:6, 12). Elsewhere, Paul uses kopiaō for the 
labor of ministry (1 Corinthians 16:16; 1 Thessalonians 5:12; 1 Timothy 5:17). 
 
Priscilla is another of Paul’s “co-workers in Christ Jesus” (Romans 16:3–4, NIV). She is 
named with her husband, Aquila, as a teacher of Apollos. The couple “took him aside and 
explained the way of God even more accurately ” (Acts 18:26). Acts also makes it clear 
that Apollos had a strong ministry  of “proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the 
Messiah” (Acts 1 8:24–28, NIV ). When the ministry team of Priscilla and Aquila  is 
mentioned, she is named first when the names are paired together. This reveals that she 
had the leading role in correcting and instructing this recognized male leader. 
 
Women were active in prophecy in the E arly Church. The Bible points out that Philip ’s

[11] Women were active in prophecy in the E arly Church. The Bible points out that Philip ’s 
four unmarried daughters were prophets (Acts 21:8 –9). First Corinthians 11:2 –16 also 
reveals that the men and women of the church were praying and prophesying.  
 
Women were also named as deacons. Phoebe, a leader in the church at Cenchrea, is 
highly commended to the church at Rome by Paul (Romans 16:1– 2). Unfortunately, 
translation biases have obscured Phoebe’s leadership position, calling her just a “servant” 
(KJV, NASB, ESV). Yet Phoebe was diakonos of the church at Cenchrea. Paul regularly 
uses this term for a minister or leader of a church. He also applied it to Jesus Christ, 
Tychicus, Epaphras, Timothy, and his own ministry.  
 
Based on the context, diakonos tends to be translated as “deacon” or “minister.” Some 
translators choose the word “deaconess” (e.g., RSV) despite diakonos being a masculine

[12] Based on the context, diakonos tends to be translated as “deacon” or “minister.” Some 
translators choose the word “deaconess” (e.g., RSV) despite diakonos being a masculine 
noun. So, it seems that diakonos is the title for an official leadership position in the Early 
Church. And the proper translation for Phoebe’ s role is “ deacon” (NIV, NLT, NRSV) or 
“minister.” Also, some translations reveal a bias by referring to Phoebe as being “helpful” 
(NLT) or a “helper” (NASB) of others , including Paul (Romans 16:2).  Based on new 
analysis of ancient Greek manuscripts, Phoebe is called either a prostatis or prostatēs by 
Paul. Both terms are leadership titles.  
 
A final, key example is Paul identifying Junia as an apostle (Romans 16:7). Beginning in 
the thirteenth century, some scholars and translators masculinized her name to Junias. It 
seems they were unwilling to admit that there was a female apostle. The name Junia is

CHRISTIANS AND CITIZENSHIP 
(Adopted by the General Presbytery in session August 4–5, 2025) 
 
Summary 
 
Christians are called to be “in the world” and “not of the world” (John 17:11–16).1 We must 
embrace our identity as Christian citizens , as public witness es, and as salt and light.  
Believers must  also maintain their Christian character wh ile engaging in politics. We 
prioritize our calling in Christ and do not condone the demonization of fellow citizens with 
whom we disagree. Such negative conduct can detract from the mission of Christ and the 
aligned Assemblies of God (AG) mission to evangelize, worship God, build disciples, and 
show compassion.

Introduction 
 
In the high priestly prayer of John 17, Jesus acknowledged that He and His followers are 
not of this world. Yet, He prayed that the Father woul d not take His followers from this 
world (vv. 14–16). This prayer offers a point of departure for discussing the relationship

[14] not of this world. Yet, He prayed that the Father woul d not take His followers from this 
world (vv. 14–16). This prayer offers a point of departure for discussing the relationship 
between Christians and civic or political systems. The term world in the New Testament 
encompasses more than government or political system s. Yet, it include s them and is 
epitomized by them.3 
 
This paper aims to offer principles that help believers learn to live 
 
1. “in the world,” as Christians bear the responsibility to represent Christ in their 
civic lives; and 
 
2.  “not of this world,” as Christians avoid being co-opted by worldly ends or seduced 
into carrying out their missional influence by worldly means. 
 
Biblical Principles

[15] The Bible offers clear principles to help Christians navigate citizenship. The apostle Paul 
told the Philippians that their “ citizenship is in heaven” (Philippians 3:20). He shared a 
similar thought in Ephesians 2:19. However, other citizenships mattered , too. Being a 
Roman citizen made a key difference for people in the ancient world. Paul valued being 
born a Roman citizen . He used his rights as a citizen to avoid unjust treatment (Acts 
22:22–29). Paul even appealed a sentence to Caesar, as was his right (Acts 25:11).

Identity 
Citizenship was a matter of primary identity for Paul. The Philippians to whom Paul wrote 
understood the idea of dual citizenship. They held citizenship in Philippi and Rome, over 
eight hundred miles apart . Their claim to status and protection came  from Rome, not 
Philippi. The distant citizenship held a primacy in their lives in terms of both benefits and 
obligations. Similarly, Christians are citizens of earth but also of a distant land— heaven. 
Like the Philippians, Christians’ citizenships vary in quality and their claims upon citizens. 
 
Paul did not call the Philippians to disavow their earthly citizenship. He contrasted himself 
(and the Christians in Philippi) with those who live as “ enemies of the cross of Christ ” 
(Philippians 3: 18). Enemies of Christ “ have their minds set on earthly things ” (3:19; 
compare Romans 8:5–6 and Colossians 3:2). They are in the world and of the world, thus,

[18] (Philippians 3: 18). Enemies of Christ “ have their minds set on earthly things ” (3:19; 
compare Romans 8:5–6 and Colossians 3:2). They are in the world and of the world, thus, 
entirely invested in worldly concerns. Followers of Paul and Christ, though they live in the 
world, are not controlled by it. Their citizenship is a heavenly one. 
 
First Peter 2:9–12 and Hebrews 11:13 also deal with Christian identity. These passages 
describe believers as foreigners and exiles on this ea rth. Peter ’s letter  also refers to 
Christians as “ a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, ” and “God’s special 
possession” who live as holy examples (1 Peter 2:9, 11–12). The next passage presents 
another major theme in the relationship between Christians and the state: submission 
and obedience to authority (1 Peter 2:13–14). 
 
Submission 
After addressing Christian identity, Peter urged his audience to submit to every human

[19] and obedience to authority (1 Peter 2:13–14). 
 
Submission 
After addressing Christian identity, Peter urged his audience to submit to every human 
authority (1 Peter 2:13–17). Though not as strongly as Paul in Romans 13, Peter asserted 
the government’s role  in affirming order  and discouraging evil . Government s are 
essential, and believers are expected to follow the law. 
 
However, the submission is “for the Lord’s sake” (1 Peter 2:13). Much stronger language 
describes believers’ duty to God than to human authorities. Believers must “live as God’s 
slaves” and “fear God” (1 Peter 2:16–17). On the other hand, though not equally, they are 
to “submit . . . to every human authority” and “honor the emperor ” (2:13, 17). Living as 
God’s slaves and fearing God are much stronger terms than submission (deference) and 
honor. Obedience to human authority is important, but such obedience is in the broader

[20] God’s slaves and fearing God are much stronger terms than submission (deference) and 
honor. Obedience to human authority is important, but such obedience is in the broader 
context of obedience to God. When obedience to earthly authorities contradicts Christian 
commitments, obedience to God is the priority. As Peter said in Acts 5:29 to the authorities 
in Jerusalem when ordered to no longer teach in the name of Jesus, “We must obey God 
rather than human beings!” 
 
Witness 
Peter and Paul depicted the Christian’s role in society with a common goal. Both voiced 
concern with Christian witness among  unbelievers. This concept of witness provides 
another guiding theme for Christians and their relationship to civic life. Matthew 28:19–20 
and Acts 1:8 clarify th e role of Christians in the world. These passages teach that

[21] 4 
“Two Kingdoms” and Reformed approaches. In twenty-first-century America, some in the 
AG stressed political power as a way to promote biblical values.  
 
Articles 10 and 11 of the “Statement of Fundamental Truths” describe the mission of the 
Church as evangelizing, worshipping God, building up believers, and showing 
compassion. This mission intersects with the political and social world. Yet, believers who 
aim to glorify God and rightly reflect His kingdom must govern such activities by mission 
principles. 
 
Principles of Christian Engagement in Citizenship 
 
The previous models provide a framework for  how Christians engage d the politics of 
society. The y aimed to live out their faith within an  in-the-world-but-not-of-the-world 
paradigm. No doubt, Christians live in the world. We work, play, and worship within 
societies that do not always  reflect our beliefs or values. Yet Christians are not of this

[22] paradigm. No doubt, Christians live in the world. We work, play, and worship within 
societies that do not always  reflect our beliefs or values. Yet Christians are not of this 
world. The Bible calls believers to reject the world ’s system s and to be transformed  
(Romans 12:1–2). Christian faith transforms the issues we engage in and how we engage 
them. 
 
Christian Identity as Primary 
Like the Philippians, we have dual citizenship. Though we are earthly citizens, we are first 
citizens of Christ ’s superior kingdom. Our primary identity does not derive f rom a 
particular earthly stat e. Instead, it comes from being “in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:28). 
The primary commitment, in terms of identification, conduct, and orientation to the world 
must be an allegiance to Christ. In the context of the United States, this  means that one 
is a  Christian before he or she is a  U.S. citizen. These two identities , though not 
necessarily in conflict, must never be confused.

[23] is a  Christian before he or she is a  U.S. citizen. These two identities , though not 
necessarily in conflict, must never be confused. 
 
Appropriate Submission as Necessary 
Citizens of heaven bear responsibility during their time as citizens of this world. God called 
believers to submit to earthly powers. Responsible citizenship includes respect  for 
governing authorities, even when disagreeing  with decisions. Citizens with a vote must  
stay well-informed. Being aware and evaluating what is happening in one’s community is 
vital. Believers must contribute to maintaining  the peace in  society, whether through 
action or example, in person or online. Embrace the opportunities citizenship offers—
voting, running for political office, showing up for jury duty, and the like. 
 
Christians should support the protection of religious freedom. No political figure, party, or 
system has the power to stop the spread of God’s kingdom. Moreover, no political figure,

[24] Christians should support the protection of religious freedom. No political figure, party, or 
system has the power to stop the spread of God’s kingdom. Moreover, no political figure, 
party, or system has the authority to represent God’ s kingdom fully . Religious freedom 
means both the freedom to worship God fully and the freedom to reject God. No one can 
truly say yes to God if they cannot also say no. We must protect the freedom to say either.  
 
Christian identity  takes priority over national identity . Similarly,  Christian obedience to 
Christ takes precedence over any earthly allegiance. Submission and obedience to God 
and the state are not identical and must never be confused. Neither 1 Peter 2:13–17 nor

[25] 5 
Romans 13:7 argues to offer the state worship.  While Christians generally obey and 
submit to earthly authorities, earthly authorities are not absolutes. All submission occurs 
under the umbrella of Christian allegiance to God. His Person and kingdom cannot be 
compared with or subjected to any earthly power. 
 
Witness as Our Core Mission 
For the New Testament writers, being witnesses of God’s reconciling work in Christ is a 
core responsibility of believers . Anything that interferes with this work opposes the 
Christian faith, no matter the motivation. Acting in the name of Christ while  undermining 
the gospel’s presentation and the Church’s mission risks disobedience to Christ (Matthew 
28:19–20). Let it not be said of us that people blaspheme the name of God because of 
us (Romans 2:24). 
 
Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present

[26] us (Romans 2:24). 
 
Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present  
simplistic answers that create us -vs-them scenarios . Desiring to make a positive 
difference in the world, well-meaning Christians often choose a side and universally adopt 
its stance on all the issues. In so doing, they can alienate others and damage their ability 
to witness to them. In a worst-case scenario, a chosen side might reveal itself as opposing 
Christian faith and virtue.  Christians must be careful in participating in any potentially 
harmful system that does not accurately represent Christ or His kingdom. 
 
Christians should ensure that their civic engagements are in harmony with their core 
task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere .

[27] task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere . 
Believers should take moral stands on issues that matter to God. However, they should 
exercise caution and discernment in how they do so, living as wise agents of Christ ’s 
kingdom. 
 
Salt and Light 
One of Jesus’ best-known teachings contains dual metaphors for Christian engagement 
with the world. “You are the salt of the earth,” He said, and “You are the light of the world” 
(Matthew 5:13–14). In the right measure, salt improves what it touches. Similarly, 
Christians improve their environment. Consider this  test for valid Christian engagement: 
Does our influence make our environment better or worse? 
 
Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in

[28] Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in 
heaven” (Matthew 5:16). Jesus expects His followers to radiate goodness that dispels the 
darkness of evil . The light of their  good works point s to the Father —the Source of 
goodness. It elicits genuine praise for God from those who observe these acts of light . 
Consider another key test  for Christian engagement: Are people drawn to God by our 
public actions and disposition, or are they turned off?

matic renewal. Leaving the Assemblies of God in 1987, he went to New York City and 
founded the nondenominational Times Square Church in the historic Mark Hellinger 
Theater in Manhattan at 51st and Broadway.
Church growth in the Pentecostal tradition has always been infl  uenced by the 
presence of charismatic leaders, whether holding formal church offi  ces or not,  clergy 
or laity, men or women. This dynamic has been a chief characteristic of the Pentecos-
tal movement, bringing with it unique strengths, as well as weaknesses.

[34] PEOPLE OF THE SPIRIT
the years, refl  ecting the ongoing expectancy of supernatural manifestations of power 
in the churches.
The ministry of Hispanic evangelist José Rojas also illustrates the anticipation of 
the Spirit’s power. Since he had not attended a Bible school, his preaching was lim-
ited to his testimony about his own personal conversion out of a life of wickedness. 
During revivals he would spend most of the nights in prayer. When the time came to 
preach, he began by singing a Spanish chorus “Dios te ve.” (“God sees you.”) In many 
of his services, he never got further than the song because people would begin to 
feel remorse for their sinful lives and make their way to the altar to repent. Hundreds 
came to Christ in this fashion. Rojas became so well known for singing this song that 
many people knew him only by the name “Dios te ve.”
Churches generally exhibited a high level of audience involvement through

[35] many people knew him only by the name “Dios te ve.”
Churches generally exhibited a high level of audience involvement through 
song, choirs, vocal and instrumental ensembles, expressive worship (clapping, 
raising hands, shouting the praises of God, and, occasionally, dancing), testi-
mony, and the gifts of the Spirit. Exuberant singing marked the services, some-
times with people in the congregation taking the liberty to lead out in a favorite 
song at an appropriate time in the service when they felt the Spirit prompt them. 
Otherwise, the song leader—usually the key worship leader next to the pastor—
selected the songs. Still the features of Pentecostal worship varied across the 
country due to cultural differences, ranging from lively Southern-style worship 
to more staid worship to the exuberant services of the Hispanic churches. (An 
Assembly of God without a pianist or guitarist, however, presented no small chal-
lenge to a worship leader.)

t was not unusual for the altar services on Sunday evening [at First Assembly] to last 
at least several hours. No one seemed anxious to leave the presence of the Lord. Men 
and women would stand, sit, or lie slain in the Spirit, worshipping God. A symphony of 
praise would rise and fall in tides. After I had ﬁ  nished praying, I turned in my seat and 
quietly worshipped with my eyes open. There were people slain in the Spirit all over 
the altar area. A woman at the far left of the altar area began gracefully dancing in the 
Spirit. She had her eyes shut and her hands were lifted high to the Lord. She began 
moving slowly across the altar area and my ﬁ  rst thought was, Oh, no, she is going to step

on someone’s hand or foot…or even worse yet, trip over someone and land right on them! In total 
amazement, I watched her gracefully dance all over the altar area from one end to the 
other without ever touching a hand, foot, or body. I knew that what I was seeing was 
totally impossible for a human being to do…a supernatural dance was being performed 
before my very eyes. Even though I was only in my early teens, I will never forget that 
supernatural performance.

[38] Perhaps refl ecting the infl  uence of the Salvation Army on early Pentecostals, 
churches often had orchestras; consequently, many young people became skilled 
musicians. Aimee Semple McPherson’s Angelus Temple in Los Angeles, California, 
sported a large “Silver Band.” 
Most orchestras, however, were 
much smaller.
The musicians at Bethel 
Temple Assembly of God in 
Canton, Ohio, had a ministry 
both within and far beyond the 
walls of the church sanctuary. 
Bob Vance, a steelworker and 
elder in the church, served as 
the director and played the 
guitar. Velma McGee was the 
equivalent of fi  rst violinist, 
assisted by the church custodian, Ed Jensen, and Gene Kulik. Kermit Snyder, an elder, 
played the drums. David McNeilly and his son played trumpets, Gary McGee made 
sounds on the baritone horn, and several other youths played clarinets. George Hartzell

[39] sounds on the baritone horn, and several other youths played clarinets. George Hartzell 
strummed the bass fi  ddle, and Lucille Kempthorn played the piano. They ministered 
in Sunday evening services and traveled several times a year in the surrounding area 
to church dedications and revivals and to hold services at nursing homes and county 
homes. This lay-driven ministry exemplifi  ed similar efforts across the country.
Unique to Pentecostal churches, the vocal utterances of the Holy Spirit (gifts of 
tongues, interpretation, and prophecy) played an important role in worship. Sover-
eignly distributed like the rest of the nine gifts (1 Corinthians 12:7–11), Pentecostals 
viewed their manifestation as indispensable to Spirit-fi  lled worship. However, it was 
clearly understood that Paul’s instructions about the exercise of these gifts (1 Cor-
inthians 14) had to be followed to insure that the work of the Spirit would not be

[40] clearly understood that Paul’s instructions about the exercise of these gifts (1 Cor-
inthians 14) had to be followed to insure that the work of the Spirit would not be 
jeopardized by poor judgment. At the Council on Spiritual Life in Minneapolis in 
1972, California pastor Dwight H. McLaughlin cautioned, “The gifts of the Spirit must 
be balanced by the fruit of the Spirit. Speaking in tongues, the gift of prophecy, all 
knowledge, all faith, even though seeming to help others, will not profi  t their users 
without love (1 Corinthians 13:1–3).”
The vision, dynamism, and growth of Pentecostal churches have been determined 
to a great degree by the pastor, aided by committed church workers. Assemblies of 
God congregations have always expected much from their pastors: They should be 
Spirit-led worship leaders, powerful preachers, prayer warriors, competent admin-

[43] The Book of Judges (19:1–30) records an incident in the ancient Benjamite city of Gibeah that has many similarities to the sin of Sodom. Certain “wicked men of the city” (19:22) sought to force a visiting Levite male into homosexual acts16 with them. Denied their insistent requests, the attackers finally settled for vicious sexual abuse and gang-rape17 of the Levite’s concubine that resulted in her death (19:25–30). The other tribes of Israel found the crime so repugnant that when the tribe of Benjamin refused to surrender the offenders, they eventually went to war—decimating the Benjamites (20:1–48).  These are particularly notorious examples of homosexual expression that undoubtedly most homosexual persons today would repudiate. It should be understood that while expressing abhorrence at such rapacious perversion, the biblical writers do not imply that heterosexuals are not capable of sexual atrocities nor that most homosexuals are as depraved as the residents of those ancient

[44] at such rapacious perversion, the biblical writers do not imply that heterosexuals are not capable of sexual atrocities nor that most homosexuals are as depraved as the residents of those ancient cities. Nor should modern Christians draw those implications. It is important to note, however, that wherever homosexuality occurs in the biblical record it is an occasion of scandal and judgment. Homosexuality is never viewed in a positive light.  The biblical writers make it clear that practicing homosexuals, along with sexually immoral heterosexuals and all other unrepentant sinners, will not inherit the kingdom of God (1 Corinthians 6:9–10). Paul also described homosexual conduct as one evidence of God’s judgment for humankind’s corporate rebellion against Him (Romans 1:26–27). Jesus himself was explicit that at the end of the age “the Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. They will throw them into the

[45] was explicit that at the end of the age “the Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth” (Matthew 13:40–42).  II. Homosexual Behavior Is Sin for Which Reconciliation Is Possible  While Scripture makes it clear homosexual behavior is sin and comes under the judgment of God, it also indicates that those who are guilty of homosexual behavior or any other sin can be reconciled to God (2 Corinthians 5:17–21).  In the church at Corinth were former homosexuals who had been delivered from the power of sin by the grace of God. In 1 Corinthians 6:9, Paul listed homosexuals along with immoral heterosexuals as those who cannot inherit the kingdom of God. His grammar implies continuing sexually immoral activity until their conversion.   Verse 11 follows with a powerful contrast, “And that is what some of you were. But you

[46] inherit the kingdom of God. His grammar implies continuing sexually immoral activity until their conversion.   Verse 11 follows with a powerful contrast, “And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.” They had been homosexuals in orientation and behavior, but now the power of God’s Spirit had radically transformed their lives, and the lives of their fellow heterosexual sinners.  Scripture makes clear that the efficacy of the death and resurrection of Christ is unlimited for those who accept it. There is no sin, sexual or otherwise, that cannot be cleansed. John the Baptist announced, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29).  The apostle Paul wrote, “God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God” (2 Corinthians 5:21).

[48] The apostle John wrote, “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9).  Through the regenerating power of the Holy Spirit, people, regardless of the nature of their sin, can be made new creations in Christ Jesus (2 Corinthians 5:17). God’s plan of salvation is the same for all. The practicing homosexual who wants to be delivered from the penalty and power of sin must come to God in the same way all heterosexual sinners must come to God, in the same way all who are now His children have come for deliverance from their sins.  The act of turning to God for salvation includes both repentance and faith. Jesus is both Savior and Lord. He is the one who forgives our sin as we believe in Him and repent. Repentance represents a change of mind in which there is a turning from sin in both attitude and behavior.  Jesus is also the One whose lordship we affirm in holy living. “It is God’s will that you should be

[49] represents a change of mind in which there is a turning from sin in both attitude and behavior.  Jesus is also the One whose lordship we affirm in holy living. “It is God’s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable, not in passionate lust like the pagans, who do not know God” (1 Thessalonians 4:3–5).  Like the Philippian jailer who asked what he had to do to be saved, those desiring salvation must believe in the Lord Jesus Christ (Acts 16:30–31)—believe that He can save from the power as well as the penalty of sin. Obedient faith, like repentance, is a condition of salvation.  III. Resultant Affirmations  In view of the clear biblical teachings on homosexuality and the application of these teachings to contemporary sexual practices, the Assemblies of God Fellowship makes the following affirmations:  A. With Regard to Same-Sex Marriage  The Assemblies of God

[50] and the application of these teachings to contemporary sexual practices, the Assemblies of God Fellowship makes the following affirmations:  A. With Regard to Same-Sex Marriage  The Assemblies of God defines marriage as the permanent, exclusive, comprehensive, and conjugal “one flesh” union of one man and one woman, intrinsically ordered to procreation and biological family, and in furtherance of the moral, spiritual, and public good of binding father, mother, and child. (Genesis 1:27–28; 2:18–24; Matthew 19:4–9; Mark 10:5–9; Ephesians 5:31–33).  B. With Regard to Sexual Immorality  The Assemblies of God believes that sexual acts outside of marriage are prohibited as sinful.  Sexual acts outside of marriage include but are not limited to adultery, fornication, incest, bestiality, pornography, prostitution, voyeurism, pedophilia, exhibitionism, sodomy, polygamy, polyamory, or same-sex sexual acts.  (Exodus 20:14; Leviticus 18:7–23; 20:10–21; Deuteronomy 5:18; Matthew 5:27–28; 15:19;

[51] prostitution, voyeurism, pedophilia, exhibitionism, sodomy, polygamy, polyamory, or same-sex sexual acts.  (Exodus 20:14; Leviticus 18:7–23; 20:10–21; Deuteronomy 5:18; Matthew 5:27–28; 15:19; Romans 1:26–27; 1 Corinthians 6:9–13; Galatians 5:19; Ephesians 4:17–19; Colossians 3:5; 1 Thessalonians 4:3; Hebrews 13:4).

[53] As Christians we must both exhort believers to live in moral purity and express in word and deed Christ’s love for the lost. Aware of the claims of God on every aspect of our lives, we must emphasize that we are called to holiness. To unbelievers we must reach out with compassion and humility. We must hold no malice toward, or fear of, homosexuals and those struggling with sexual identity—such attitudes are not of Christ. At the same time we must not condone sexual behavior, homosexual or heterosexual, that God has defined as sinful.   Christians should also do all they can to assist the person who has struggled with homosexual behaviors and desires to change and find deliverance. Change is not always easy but it is possible. It may require the help of others in the body of Christ, such as counselors and pastors, as well as a supportive church fellowship. Christian organizations are also available to help those who seek to change their lifestyles.   We desire all to be reconciled to

[54] as counselors and pastors, as well as a supportive church fellowship. Christian organizations are also available to help those who seek to change their lifestyles.   We desire all to be reconciled to God—to experience the peace and joy that stems from the forgiveness of sin through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. God does not want any to perish in their sins; He invites all to accept His offer of eternal life (John 3:16). As part of His church, we issue that invitation to life in Christ to everyone.  Notes 1 The term homosexuality is frequently used to describe both orientation and behavior. In this paper, homosexual orientation is understood to mean sexual attraction to other members of the same sex. Homosexual behavior is understood to mean participation in sexual activity with another of the same sex. Homosexual orientation may pose temptations to lustful thinking and behavior, like heterosexual temptations, that are not necessarily acted upon and that may be resisted

[55] with another of the same sex. Homosexual orientation may pose temptations to lustful thinking and behavior, like heterosexual temptations, that are not necessarily acted upon and that may be resisted and overcome in the power of the Holy Spirit. Only homosexual lust and homosexual behaviors are understood in this study to be sinful.  2 Some sexual preference groups may prefer a different designation but, in the absence of a universally agreed-upon term, LGBT, generally understood in contemporary circles, is used here to include all “nonstraight” communities.”  3 All biblical citations are from the New International Version unless otherwise noted.  4 Here meaning to refrain from illicit sexual activity.  5 Here meaning sexual faithfulness and exclusivity in marriage.  6 The Hebrew word found here, to’ebah, is also used in this chapter of Leviticus for various abominable sexual practices of Israel’s pagan neighbors (18:26–27,29–30).

Waltke, eds., Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament (Chicago: Moody Press, 1980), 2:976–77. It is not uncommon for revisionists to attempt to explain away the plain meaning of the text by assuming the homosexual acts to be judged wrong only because they were associated with pagan religious practices forbidden to Israel. However, nothing in the passages cited supports this interpretation and the fact that homosexual practice is implicitly or explicitly condemned wherever it appears in the biblical text negates this interpretation.  7 “[N]atural intercourse,” New Revised Standard Version (NRSV); Greek chresis has to do with sexual intercourse in such contexts.

Along with homosexuality, the apostle Paul includes such heterosexual sins as adultery, fornication, and prostitution. (See also such passages as Galatians 5:19–21 and 1 Timothy 1:10.) The Assemblies of God stands against all sexual immorality, heterosexual or homosexual, and calls all participants to repentance.  11 “[M]ale prostitutes” is translated from the Greek plural of malakos; “homosexual offenders” is translated from the plural of arsenokoites.

They also conclude from Hebrews 13:2 (“some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it”) and Matthew 10:14–15 (“shake the dust off your feet”) that the sin of Sodom was nothing more than inhospitality. It is further claimed that even if the references to Sodom describe

It is further claimed that even if the references to Sodom describe homosexual behavior, it is actually male rape, not consensual homosexual relations, that are denounced. While the Genesis account does not answer all our questions, it is clear from the story itself and the many references in both Testaments that promiscuous and violent homosexuality is in view.   15 “[H]ave sex” is in this context an accurate translation of the Hebrew  yada’, which means “to know” but is frequently used as a euphemism for sexual intercourse (Genesis 4:1, NRSV).

hen the Assemblies of God marked its seventy-fi  fth anniversary at the Gen-
eral Council meeting in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1989, nostalgia carried 
the day. Delegates celebrated the denomination’s remaining faithful to the 
vision originally articulated in April 1914 at Hot Springs. Recalling the spiritual roots 
of the denomination and looking toward the future, Charles Crabtree, the keynote 
speaker, preaching from John 4:34–38, told his audience that the Holy Spirit was say-
ing three things to the Church: “It is time for a spiritual harvest, it is time for a biblical 
Pentecost,” and “it is time for fervent prayer.”
As everyone knew, momentous changes had taken place. For some years, the

[8] Indeed, by the last decade of the century, the saints differed considerably from 
those at Hot Springs who expected that at any moment the trumpet call would sound 
and the Church would be caught up to be with the Lord in the clouds (1 Thessalo-
nians 4:16–17). Ministers now invested in retirement annuities, fretted over rising 
costs of hospitalization, scrutinized fringe benefi  ts, and kept a close eye on IRS poli-
cies that affected housing allowances.
Missionaries whose counterparts had gone overseas on faith and limited fi nances 
now took nearly two years to raise required budgets, itinerating among the churches 
to raise monthly pledges of thousands of dollars to support themselves and fund 
projects helpful to national churches. The headquarters in Springfi  eld grew in size 
and scope of operation, while districts began building multimillion-dollar facilities 
to improve the effi  ciency of their own operations.

ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES
The growing size of the denomination required a streamlining of its national oper-
ation, according to the Committee on Advance, which had been working on a self-study 
of the organization since 1967. With its recommendations in hand, the 1971 General 
Council in Kansas City, Missouri, adopted major changes. The fi  ve assistant general 
superintendents were replaced with a single assistant general superintendent who 
would serve without a specifi  c administrative portfolio—G. Raymond Carlson won 
the vote for this offi  ce. The portfolios on home missions, church ministries, Christian 
education, and publishing, previously held by four of the assistants, went to “national 
directors,” elected by the Executive Presbytery and ratifi  ed by the General Presbytery.

they had remained true to their spiritual heritage: “In a time when religious structures 
are being exposed as so rigid and infl  exible as to discourage any hope among the 
young that the organized Church can be a viable structure through which the love and 
life of God in Christ can fl  ow toward human need, the Assemblies of God has demon-
strated to its youth once more that we are determined to resist the historical face of 
denominationalism. We are determined to stay a revival movement.”
Streamlining, however, did not mean a reduction of programs or employees, but an 
attempt to improve effi  ciency. Indeed, the size of the headquarters operation in Spring-
fi eld continued to expand as programs grew. District offi  ces also added personnel and 
expanded their scope of activities. More Hispanic districts were formed because of 
rapid growth, and the Korean district came into existence in 1982.

[13] expanded their scope of activities. More Hispanic districts were formed because of 
rapid growth, and the Korean district came into existence in 1982.
The 1973 General Council in Miami made signifi  cant decisions as well. First, it 
changed a long-standing policy of forbidding ministers from performing the wedding 
of a divorced person whose spouse was still living. Though not approving divorce, the 
decision was designed to assist ministers to help people who had marital entangle-
ments prior to their conversion.
8 Yet despite the rising divorce rate in the culture, the 
Council did not change its refusal to credential a person with a living former spouse. 
(That came at the 2001 General Council in Kansas City with the following resolu-
tion: “We disapprove of any married person holding ministerial credentials with the 
Assemblies of God if either marriage partner has a former companion living, unless the

Assemblies of God if either marriage partner has a former companion living, unless the 
divorce occurred prior to his or her conversion or except as hereinafter provided.”

Second, the delegates in Miami implemented a rehabilitation program for min-
isters, which had been in the works for some time. To be redemptive in orientation, it 
required the minister to cease ministerial activities for a period of time; with accept-
able conduct and progress, the minister could apply for the reinstatement of creden-
tials and continue in ministry. No one could foresee how severely the policy would be 
tested in a few short years.
Another important change came several years later in 1991 when the denomina-
tion restructured the popular Mobilization and Placement Service (MAPS) between 
home and foreign spheres of activity. For the Division of Foreign Missions, it became

Service. “MAPS is not diminishing,” said Lamar Headley, director of Mission Abroad. 
“In fact, we expect it to grow. As home and foreign missions efforts place emphases 
on their own areas, there should be an increase in participation from Assemblies of 
God people across the nation.”
10 The growth of both programs proved him right.

General Superintendent Thomas E. Trask tirelessly called the Fellowship “back to 
altar” with a hunger for revival, passionate prayer, and total surrender to the will of 
God. Trask led the Convoy of Hope Prayer Initiative, reminding all participants that 
supernatural power is the foundation for all outreach, from preaching to feeding the 
poor and the victims of tragedies. 
He currently leads the Global Prayer Initiative and the “12-12” Movement, calling 
upon God’s people to dedicate December 12 of each year to praying for the poor.
 CHARLES T. CRABTREE
Charles Crabtree served as assistant general superintendent until accepting a 
call as president of Zion Bible College in 2007. Zion (now Northpoint Bible College)

INTRODUCTION AND REMEMBRANCE
P
eople of the Spirit by the late Dr. Gary B. McGee is an appreciative and critical look 
at the Assemblies of God (USA) history through a biographical lens. His respect 
for the women and men that have led and served is evident. He is also forth-
coming on some of the failures and shortcomings that are part of the narrative. In 
between the biographical profi  les, Dr. McGee highlights important trends, connecting 
the Assemblies of God with global Pentecostal and charismatic movements and well 
as larger Christian missions trends and world events. 
This brief afterword helps to bring the story current as the Assemblies of God 
celebrates its centennial. It highlights key events between 2002 and 2014, with several 
biographical profi les.

[8] A DECADE OF GROWTH AND TRANSFORMATION
The last ten years have seen unprecedented global growth for Pentecostal/
charismatic Christianity. Spirit baptism, manifestation gifts, healings, and miracles 
are normative as Christians in developing nations multiply in number and infl uence. 
The number of Christians identifying with Pentecostal/charismatic movements over-
all is somewhere between six hundred and seven hundred million. An amazing story 
for a movement not even acknowledged by leaders at the 1910 World Missionary 
Conference in Edinburgh!
In the last decade, the Assemblies of God has experienced growth in many of its 
diverse districts. Renewed passion for prayer, strategic planting, and revitalization are 
making an impact. Between 2010 and 2013, there has been a net gain of 335 churches. 
As of this writing, the Fellowship is planting one church a day in the United States 
and rapidly moving toward its goal of four thousand new churches by 2020.

Garrison is the author of several works, including the recent Acts 2 Church and The 
360O Disciple (Gospel Publishing House). Both of these books focus on the biblical and 
practical fruit of true discipleship and offer practical insights for equipping congrega-
tions for their missional calling.
JAMES T. BRADFORD
Another leader with advanced education, James T. Bradford, assumed the offi ce 
of general secretary in 2008 after John Palmer resigned (Bradford was elected in 2009 
and reelected in 2013).
Bradford is a scientist with a PhD in aerospace engineering from the University 
of Minnesota. After fi  nishing his degree, God called him to pastoral ministry, with 
great fruitfulness. In 1988, he accepted the call as senior pastor of Newport Mesa 
Christian Center in California. His early Canadian roots were re-established when he 
accepted the pastorate of Broadway Church in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2000.

Bradford’s offi  ce is also engaged in a variety of educational and empowering 
initiatives. This includes cosponsoring with Evangel University the 2011 and 2014 
Faith and Science Conferences in coordination with the AG Alliance for Higher Edu-

DOUG CLAY
In 2008, Rev. Doug Clay was appointed to fi  ll the unexpired term of James 
Bridges. His 2009 election and 2013 re-election represents expanded diversity in 
age and experience. Clay came to the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) with fruitful 
leader ship in youth/student ministries, including director of National Youth Minis-
tries (1995–1997). He was a successful pastor of a turnaround church (Calvary Assem-
bly of God in Toledo, Ohio, from 1997–2004), and district superintendent in Ohio 
(2004–2008). As superintendent, he led a transformation of district offi ces, resources,

(2004–2008). As superintendent, he led a transformation of district offi ces, resources, 
and structures, improving fi  nancial stability, resourcing more church planting, and 
offering exemplary relational and strategic leadership.
He is the author of Dreaming in 3D (Infl  uence Resources) and multiple practical guides 
for growing in discernment and wisdom as a leader. He is particularly focused on seeing 
more young adults fi  nd the insights and resources they need to fulfi  ll their callings.
When asked by seminary students in 2013 why he loved the Assemblies of God, 
Clay responded, “Missions! I love the fact that we were founded with the purpose of 
world evangelization. May we never lose that focus!”

[14] GREG MUNDIS
Greg Mundis was elected the executive director of Assemblies of God World Mis-
sions (AGWM) in 2011 at the 54th General Council. He came to this position with 
more than thirty years of foreign missionary experience in church planting, leader-
ship development, and fi  eld and regional administration. Under the leadership of 
Greg Mundis, AGWM continues to transform its methods and structures to respond 
to opportunities and complete the Great Commission. 
A native of Youngstown, Ohio, Mundis became a born-again believer at age thir-
teen through the ministry of Billy Graham, and was baptized in the Holy Spirit at the 
age of sixteen. While a student at Youngstown State University, he heard the call to 
ministry. He is a graduate of Central Bible College, the Assemblies of God Theolog-
ical Seminary (AGTS), and he earned his doctor of ministry from Gordon-Conwell

Theological Seminary. This deep commitment to being a “scholar on fi  re” made Mun-
dis an effective leader in the challenging missions fi  elds of Europe. 
Mundis and his wife, Sandie, served in Austria for seventeen years. Their duties 
included outreach and equipping—through Global University—a variety of evange-
listic outreaches to all ages, Christian radio and television, leadership empowerment, 
and church planting efforts. One of their most notable achievements is the planting 
and growth of Vienna Christian Center. Today this church numbers over two thousand 
members, a rare megachurch in post-Christian Europe. In 1991, they were appointed

ZOLLIE L. SMITH, JR.
Zollie Smith, director of AGUSM, is the fi  rst African-American to hold an exec-
utive leadership position and a key voice in transforming some of the structures for 
unleashing even more workers into the domestic harvest. He was elected in 2009 and 
reelected in 2013. He previously served as the leader of the AG National Black Fellow-
ship and in leadership roles in the New Jersey district offi ce. 
Zollie Smith’s unique educational and occupational background equips him well 
for the diverse ministries he oversees. His bachelor’s degree is in criminal justice and 
his master’s degree is in business management. Like Bradford, God called him from 
these fi  elds to pastoral ministry. He earned a diploma in ministerial studies from 
Berean College.

to these fruitful efforts, his adult journey has included times as United States postal 
inspector and as a police offi  cer and detective. He was also decorated with a Bronze 
Star and Purple Heart for his service in Vietnam as an Airborne Infantryman.
Smith shares the mission in a compassionate, direct, and personal style, calling 
on every believer to evangelize and disciple. 
CHANGES IN THE EXECUTIVE PRESBYTERY
ORDAINED MINISTER UNDER 40

[19] refl ecting the growing diversity of the Assemblies of God. One was the addition of an 
“ordained minister under 40.” The aging of ministerial leader-
ship and the desire for listening to younger voices had been 
growing for two decades. R. Bryan Jarrett, a senior pastor from 
the Dallas-Fort Worth area, was elected to this offi  ce at the 
2009 General Council. He expressed gratitude for the “forward 
thinking” of the leadership. This position is a mission-critical 
one, as the median age of ordained ministers has increased 
from fi  fty in 1979 to fi  fty-nine in 2013.
Jarrett has accomplished much as a young leader. In his 
own words, he testifi  es to God’s grace:
I grew up in a small farm town on the Arkansas side of the Mississippi River. 
My mom and I spent most of my formative years in the home of my conserva-
tive Pentecostal grandparents. As a teen, I rebelled against the legalism that

[21] our little town. In the fall of 1990, while in a drunken stupor, I had an encoun-
ter with God that altered my life and eternity. My life had been so marked by 
God that others compared my dramatic transformation to that of Paul’s on the 
Damascus Road. There was an immediate passion to reproduce in others what 
God had started in me. On November 25, 1990, my fi  rst sermon was delivered 
to a group of seventy-fi  ve students ninety minutes before I was to be baptized. 
Four of them gave their lives to Christ and the fi  ve of us were baptized together. 
I was hooked!
Jarrett graduated from Central Bible College and completed his graduate studies 
at Oral Roberts University—all while married and preaching full time. “God has gra-
ciously expanded the reach of our ministry from the little room of seventy-fi  ve stu-
dents to opportunities around the world. But the most rewarding part of our ministry

and the greatest honor of our lives is being called “Pastor” at Northplace Church in 
Sachse, Texas.”
His book Extravagant is one of the best-selling Infl  uence Resources books since 
its release in 2011.
ORDAINED FEMALE
Another new position was an ordained female executive presbyter. The growing 
number of credentialed women refl  ects the missional and theological commitment 
of the Movement to recognize God’s calling on “all fl  esh.” Beth Grant was elected and 
is currently serving in this role. At the 2007 Council, she was 
one of the top three candidates in the balloting for assistant 
general superintendent, the fi  rst time in General Council his-
tory that a female candidate received such affi  rmation. Grant 
has teamed with her husband, David, in missionary ministry 
since 1976. A Central Bible College and AGTS graduate with

since 1976. A Central Bible College and AGTS graduate with 
a PhD in intercultural studies from Biola University, she has 
taught cross-cultural understanding and missions for more 
than twenty years. She is part of the regular faculty at AGTS 
and with her husband coordinates the efforts of Project Rescue 
(more about this below). 
Grant brings a voice of insight, reason, and missionary focus to the various stra-
tegic groups she is part of. For more than a decade, she served as the chair of the Net-
work for Women in Ministry of the Assemblies of God. This growing group encourages 
and resources credentialed female leaders. 
ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE EXECUTIVE PRESBYTER
The 2009 Council also saw a third new Executive Presbytery position estab-
lished for the Language Area—East Spanish region. Saturnino (Nino) Gonzalez was 
chosen as the fi  rst representative in this offi ce.

[25] PEOPLE OF THE SPIRIT
SHIFTS IN PHILOSOPHY OF THE U.S. ASSEMBLIES OF GOD
FIVE CORE VALUES
In 2008, General Superintendent Wood published a strategic book called Core 
Values. He and the ELT affi  rmed that these values would guide their leadership within 
the fourfold mission of the Fellowship. These core values are:
• Passionately proclaim, at home and abroad, by word and deed, Jesus as 
Savior, Baptizer in the Holy Spirit, Healer, and Soon-Coming King
• Strategically invest in the next generation
• Vigorously plant new churches
• Skillfully resource our constituency
• Fervently pray for God’s favor and help as we serve Him with pure hearts and 
noble purpose
The fi  rst and last values are the essential foundations for the middle three. With-
out the passion for “the whole Church taking the whole gospel to the whole world,” 
the very reason for the Fellowship ceases to exist. And the fuel for this fearless proc-

[26] out the passion for “the whole Church taking the whole gospel to the whole world,” 
the very reason for the Fellowship ceases to exist. And the fuel for this fearless proc-
lamation is prayer—fervent, Spirit-inspired, sustaining intercession and petition that 
God uses to transform lives. 
The AG Trust is one key resource emerging from the integration of these fi ve val-
ues. Established under Wood’s leadership in 2008 and administrated under Assistant 
General Superintendent Alton Garrison, the Trust represents stewardship maturation 
of the Fellowship as long-term endowments are invested in 
• Planting new churches: In partnership with Church Multiplication Network, 
in the past fi  ve years, 275 churches have been helped with $2.42 million paid 
forward as matching funds. Over half a million people have received a clear 
presentation of the gospel and nineteen thousand decisions for Christ. These 
new plants have an average attendance of eighty-fi  ve in weekly worship.

new plants have an average attendance of eighty-fi  ve in weekly worship. 
• Helping existing churches become healthier: Healthy Church Network is 
resourcing churches ready to improve their effectiveness. 
• Providing scholarships for the training of young ministers at AG schools: 
Already $1.4 million dollars in scholarships and debt relief have been given 
to young ministers.
• Creating new church resources: Digital resources for children and youth, and 
a variety of products have been designed to resource the local church, reach-
ing thousands of AG churches and blessing other Pentecostal fellowships.
The decentralized and entrepreneurial nature of the Fellowship—an important 
part of the DNA of a “voluntary cooperative fellowship”—makes the progress of the AG 
Trust truly historic as churches and individuals give strategically and for the long-term.

[29] COMPASSION: A FOURTH REASON FOR BEING
General Council 2009 was an important moment as the Fellowship added a 
fourth reason for being. The three historic reasons for being are evangelism, worship, 
and discipleship. The fourth, compassion, represents the expansion of the evange-
listic and missionary vision, and the anointed success of ministries such as Convoy 
of Hope and HealthCare Ministries led by Joanne Butrin. Adopting this fourth reason 
for being refl  ected the growth and maturity of the Movement without any dilution of 
missionary urgency. Historic ministries such as Mission of Mercy in Calcutta founded 
by Mark and Huldah Buntain integrated Pentecostal evangelism, discipleship, and 
leadership training with excellent feeding and medical programs. Recent efforts such 
as Operation Rescue for victims of sex traffi  cking, led by David and Beth Grant, and 
Convoy of Hope, which works with Assemblies of God churches and other churches

[30] as Operation Rescue for victims of sex traffi  cking, led by David and Beth Grant, and 
Convoy of Hope, which works with Assemblies of God churches and other churches 
to feed the poor and provide relief efforts across the United States and on the foreign 
missions fi elds, are evidence of this whole-life evangelism and discipleship approach. 
The vote was close and took two business sessions to pass. The global missions 
to the unreached continue to expand and often integrate compassion expressions 
and even economic development in order to reach closed nations. 
HEADQUARTERS TO NATIONAL LEADERSHIP AND RESOURCE CENTER
When re-elected general superintendent in August 2009, Dr. George O. Wood felt 
impressed by the Holy Spirit to get hold of the business operations of the General 
Council. Gospel Publishing House revenues were declining, national ministry depart-
ments were siloed, and the welter of publications emanating from the national offi ce

[31] Council. Gospel Publishing House revenues were declining, national ministry depart-
ments were siloed, and the welter of publications emanating from the national offi ce 
provided adherents with redundant and sometimes contradictory information. If the 
Assemblies of God Fellowship wanted to respond to the cultural challenges of the 
twenty-fi rst century—challenges such as the information revolution, the fl  attening 
of leadership hierarchies, multiculturalism, and globalization—the national offi  ce 
needed to be restructured for greater effectiveness and effi ciency.
The reorganization began in early 2010 with a name change. For years, the national 
offi ce had been affectionately referred to as “Headquarters.” But as Wood humor-
ously observed, “We are the ‘head’ of no one and do not ‘quarter’ anyone either!” 
So the name was changed to the National Leadership and Resource Center (NLRC). 
This change was not cosmetic, however. Instead, it embodied Wood’s vision to align

[32] So the name was changed to the National Leadership and Resource Center (NLRC). 
This change was not cosmetic, however. Instead, it embodied Wood’s vision to align 
everything the national offi  ce does by way of leadership and resources with the goal 
of equipping the local church for health. Toward that end, the NLRC would produce 
Spirit-empowered resources for ministries to children, youth, adults, and families, 
as well as resources for church development and leadership. By doing so, the NLRC 
would become the premier ministry resource provider not only for its own churches, 
but also for the broader Pentecostal, charismatic, and evangelical communities.
The fi  rst structural change came in September 2009 when Sol Arledge, Jr., joined 
the NLRC as a consultant, and in May 2011, as chief operating offi  cer (COO). This new

[34] Soon after this vision was born, Arledge met Steve Blount, who at the time was 
an executive pastor at The Oaks Fellowship, an Assemblies of God congregation in 
Red Oak, Texas, pastored by Scott Wilson. Arledge learned that Blount and his wife, 
Susan, had an extensive publishing background with LifeWay Publishers and with 
their own publishing and media company. Additionally, the Blounts consulted with 
denominations on publishing strategies, managing change, and aligning organiza-
tions for performance. Arledge contracted with the Blounts to implement My Healthy 
Church and Infl  uence Resources. Both of these publishing initiatives debuted at the 
2011 General Council.
My Healthy Church is the imprint for resources designed for the broader 
Pentecostal and charismatic community. It also serves as the distribution arm for

ers—to a growing network of churches and bookstores. Since its launch in 2011, My

[35] obtaining AG resources—and those of select other publishers and content provid-
ers—to a growing network of churches and bookstores. Since its launch in 2011, My 
Healthy Church has become the offi  cial resource provider for an increasing number of 
like-minded denominations and associations of churches, enabling the Assemblies 
of God to expand its reach and impact from its own 12,792 churches to nearly triple 
that number in just three years. 
Mi Iglesia Saludable is the Spanish-language side of My Healthy Church. Today, 
nearly one hundred distributors provide training and education, marketing, and sales 
support to Hispanic churches, bookstores, and libraries in the United States, Latin 
America, and throughout the world. 
The inspiration behind My Healthy Church is Acts 2:42–47, which describes fi  ve 
characteristics of a healthy church: pursuing and obeying God passionately (Worship), 
engaging and maintaining loving relationships (Connect), developing and mobilizing

[36] characteristics of a healthy church: pursuing and obeying God passionately (Worship), 
engaging and maintaining loving relationships (Connect), developing and mobilizing 
people (Grow), acting with clear direction and outward focus (Serve), and reproduc-
ing and multiplying His mission in other people and places (Go). Alton Garrison 
outlined these characteristics in his 2009 book, The Acts 2 Church.
Infl uences Resources is the imprint for resources designed for the broader evan-
gelical market. It provides a way to take what is happening in the Assemblies of 
God and present it to those outside the Fellowship. General Superintendent Wood 
explains it this way: “Some of the most creative and effective evangelism, church 
growth, and discipleship endeavors are being done by the Assemblies of God pas-
tors and leaders. Often their story has not even been told within our Fellowship, 
let alone the broader Christian world. I believe what these pastors and authors are

[37] tors and leaders. Often their story has not even been told within our Fellowship, 
let alone the broader Christian world. I believe what these pastors and authors are 
experiencing has the potential to enrich ministers and laity all across the Christian 
community.”
These resources range in style and format for all ages, including books and Bible 
studies for leaders and laypeople, comic books and graphic novels, ebooks, and apps. 
Recognizing the role that music plays in culture, Infl  uence Music launched in 2013, 
giving Infl  uence Resources yet another media format to reach the world for Christ. Its 
fi rst praise and worship CD debuted at number 1 on the Nielsen SoundScan music 
chart for its category.

under the leadership of Michael Clarensau, offers an array of services for churches

THE NETWORK FOR WOMEN IN MINISTRY
Another ministry established in the last decade is the Network for Women in 
Ministry, dedicated to “developing, mentoring, and resourcing vocational women 
ministers and women preparing for ministry.” It is helping the Fellowship live up to its

[39] Ministry, dedicated to “developing, mentoring, and resourcing vocational women 
ministers and women preparing for ministry.” It is helping the Fellowship live up to its 
core commitment to recognize and release anointed servants for the harvest. Leaders 
such as Beth Grant, Jodi Detrick, and current director, Judy Rachels, are respond-
ing to the unique needs of women called to evangelistic, missionary, and pastoral 
ministries. Between 2000 and 2013, the percentage of female credential holders has 
increased from 16.3 percent to 22.3 percent of all credentialed ministers. By 2020, 
women are projected to number more than one-quarter of all credentialed ministers 
in the Assemblies of God and exercise increasing infl  uence in the Fellowship.

[42] THE TRANSFORMATION OF AG SCHOOLS IN SPRINGFIELD
For over fi  fty years there have been a variety of attempts to consolidate or merge 
the AG schools in Springfi  eld—Central Bible College and Evangel University. Central 
Bible College (CBC) has focused for ninety years on undergraduate preparation for 
full-time ministry, while Evangel provides Christ-centered Pentecostal education for 
liberal arts and professional vocations. In the 1960s, J. Robert Ashcroft was president 
of both schools and commuted between campuses for fi  ve years. He desired both 
missions to continue on one campus. Robert Cooley and other leaders initiated mul-
tiple attempts to unite these schools, along with AGTS into one consolidated univer-
sity with an embedded seminary. 
In October 2010, the ELT received two reports from concerned faculty urging con-
solidation with the continuation of all three missions. This prompted a meeting with

In October 2010, the ELT received two reports from concerned faculty urging con-
solidation with the continuation of all three missions. This prompted a meeting with 
educators, Alliance leadership, and General Superintendent Wood. After discussion 
and prayer, the participants agreed that consolidation was a good plan, but further 
prayer and work, along with fi  nancial provision, would be needed. 
The next day, completely separate from this meeting, Wood received a call from 
the Green family, owners of Hobby Lobby, offering a gift of fi  ve million dollars to help 
toward the consolidation of the Springfi  eld schools. This was the sign needed to start 
a rapid process that included General Council approval of the consolidation—pend-
ing approval from the accrediting agencies—in August 2011. The Higher Learning 
Commission and the Association of Theological Schools granted full approval on 
April 15, 2013.

As a result of much of hard work before and after fi  nal approval by the accrediting 
associations, there is now one consolidated Evangel University, with the undergrad-
uate ministry majors of CBC continuing and AGTS as an embedded seminary. The 
missions of all three institutions will continue with greater effi  ciencies, integration of 
learning, and continued focus on Pentecostal empowerment for service in all voca-
tions. Although CBC no longer exists as an independent school, its endowments and 
scholarships for ministry continue and the General Council commitment to under-
graduate ministry training is stronger than ever.

TRANSFORMING ETHNIC RELATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES
A WINDOW OF CHANGE IN THE USA: HISPANIC LEADERS
There has been a transformation of the ethnic diversity in the U.S. Assemblies of 
God. By 2014, one-third of all local churches and more than 40 percent of adherents 
were ethnic minorities and immigrants, a signifi  cant increase. The Spanish ethnic/
language districts in particular have seen remarkable growth.
This change in demographics and outreach is personifi  ed in the honor bestowed

[48] on the senior pastor of New Life Covenant Church in Chicago, Rev. Wilfredo De Jesús, 
known to his fl  ock as Pastor Choco. Time magazine, in its April 18, 
2013, edition named Pastor Choco one of the one hundred most 
infl uential people in the United States. His church is ranked as 
the largest in the Assemblies of God. He is currently vice pres-

ence and the author of Amazing Faith and In the Gap (Infl  uence 
Resources). 
In 1997, while still an associate pastor, De Jesús insisted 
that his church respond to the city’s request that they help the 
homeless and needy. River of Life Shelter was established with 
modest fi  nancial help from the city and the generous giving of 
time and treasure of the church, which at the time numbered about one hundred

tasks, Pastor Choco declares that one can begin with just a handful of willing people

León, Sr.), are also among the top churches in the Movement. 
INCREASE OF NATIONAL BLACK FELLOWSHIP CHURCHES
The National Black Fellowship has enjoyed a season of increase during the last 
decade. In 2002, there were 226 churches with 164,071 people in attendance. By 
2012, the number of churches had increased to 363 churches, refl  ecting a 60 percent

Herbert Cooper, pastor of the over 4,500 member People’s Church in Oklahoma City, 
was noted by Outreach magazine as one of thirty emerging infl  uencers in Christian 
ministry today.
The National Black Fellowship has also become a platform for black pastors 
and ministers to become more involved in the leadership of the districts where their 
churches are. They are serving as district executive presbyters, on district committees, 
and in other district leadership positions. Notable examples of the many black mini-
sters emerging as leaders in the Assemblies of God are Michael Nelson, Peninsular 
Florida dis trict, president of the National Black Fellowship and General Council

THE MEMPHIS MIRACLE BEARS NEW FRUIT: RECONCILIATION AND PARTNERSHIP IN MISSION
HEALING A SCHISM
In 2010, the Rev. Thomas Barclay, international presiding elder of the United Pen-
tecostal Council of the Assemblies of God (UPCAG), reached out to the Assemblies of 
God with a desire to heal a schism dating back to 1917. In 1917, an African-American 
minister named Alexander Howard requested AG appointment as a missionary to 
Liberia. Sadly, he was refused due to his race. By 1919, a group of churches in the

[53] Liberia. Sadly, he was refused due to his race. By 1919, a group of churches in the 
northeast United States was formed out of this rejection and have remained a small 
but vibrant Pentecostal witness. Rev. Barclay reached out and was warmly received 
at the 2011 General Council as he shared his historic journey and deep desire for 
cooperation. 
Rev. Barclay’s courage and the humility of Assemblies of God leaders culminated 
in a historic agreement for “cooperative affi  liation” signed on February 11, 2014. 
UPCAG churches are now welcomed into local districts and national ministries, and 
maintain their own credentialing. This was truly a moment of divine redemption.

🧠 Query: how many universities have chi alpha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📄 Context Sent to Model:
[1] ﬁ rst on-campus group of students as a pilot project for a program that would soon be 
called Chi Alpha (XA). As the program grew across the United States, it moved from cen-
tering on Assemblies of God students to recognizing the university as a strategic place 
for evangelism and discipleship. When C. David Gable became the national director of 
Chi Alpha in 1971, the endeavor blossomed in new ways through the addition of SALT 
(Student Activist Leadership Training) conferences, Institute of Campus Missions (after 
2000 known as Reach the University Institute), District Chi Alpha Directors Conference, 
and Campus Ministers Conference. Under his leadership, the ﬁ vefold Chi Alpha mission 
statement began to evolve that grounds the purpose of the organization in providing 
a campus community for worship, fellowship, discipleship, witness, and prayer. Over-
seas activities were launched when Jerry and Pat Sandidge pioneered University Action

[2] fulfi lling the Great Com-
mission in our day. We 
can reach students if we 
bring the gospel into the 
university environment 
where students live, 
study, and congregate. 
College students are 
more open to consider-
ing the claims of Jesus 
Christ while on the uni-
versity campus than at 
any other time in their 
lives.” 
46
With 221 Chi Alpha personnel having appointment as national U.S. missionaries 
in 2003, they could be found across the country on secular campuses. Along with its 
campus chapters, intensive discipleship-training program, and national conferences, 
the organization has begun to equip international students with skills for evangelism 
when they return to their home countries. In refl  ecting on both American and inter-
national students who have gone through the Chi Alpha program, veteran campus 
minister Joe Zickafoose stated: “Students I’ve seen who come through the fi  re of a

[3] from home. She immediately responded, 
“Yes, but I  love Chi Alpha.” Not only had 
she found Christ, but a family of warm 
friends as well. Already the crossroads of 
global culture, universities have offered 
unique opportunities for ministry.
The work of Chi Alpha, which began 
in 1953, continued to fl  ourish under the 
administration of Dennis Gaylor, who suc-
ceeded C. David Gable in 1979 and has 
remained at the post. Familiar with the uni-
versity context, Gaylor had graduated from 
North Texas State Uni versity and completed 
an MA degree at the University of Houston. 
While serving as youth pastor at Lindale Assem bly of God in Houston, a campus min-
ister, Her schel Rosser, invited him to a Chi Alpha conference. This opened the eyes of 
Gaylor and his wife, Barbara, to the potential fruitfulness of such ministry. Following 
his own experience in campus min istry, he served as South Texas district’s Chi Alpha

MINISTRY IN THE CROSSROADS
By the year 2000, the world had become a global village. The long-cherished 
distinction between U.S. and foreign missions had blurred. Mission to the peoples of 
Colombia, Haiti, Nigeria, India, China, and the Pacifi  c Islands could be done in the 
cities of North America as well. 
Neither could the mission of the Church be neatly separated from the physical 
needs of people any longer. As had so frequently happened in Assemblies of God his-

tory, ministries of Word and deed naturally worked together, as in the case of Rocky

alcohol, drugs, and crime, his ministry then gravitated “to those affl  icted by drugs and 
alcohol and showing them they can overcome their circumstances.”

D.C., Marvin Calderon planted a Hispanic church with the partnership of Assemblies of 
God U.S. Missions, Convoy of Hope, and the Spanish Eastern district.
43 After the 2000

and university students were converted and discipled, they would evangelize in the 
far corners of the earth.
A former gang member, Patrick Donadio went on to pioneer churches in Alaska

[8] Espinoza grew up in poverty as an army brat. Determined to make something of his 
life, he earned an associate’s degree in science and then enrolled in the College of 
Pharmacy of the University of Houston. A scholarship and an offer of a career from 
a pharmaceutical company seemed to guarantee a bright future. “All this time,” he 
recalled, “I had been pushing aside a calling on my life. While I thought I had my 
future under control, I was unhappy, because life without 
a personal, nurturing relationship with God is harsh.”
Visiting his fi  ancé, Elois Patton, in San Antonio, he 
attended Sunday service at Highlands Assembly of God 
where he had a transforming spiritual experience: “This 
was the fi  rst and only time I  have danced in the Spirit, 
but after a prolonged experience in the presence of God,

located in El Paso), he applied to the school, though he 
had lost his fl  uency in Spanish. After his freshman year, 
Efraim and Elois were married.
After graduation three years later, he felt prepared for 
ministry. In those years, the superintendent of the Gulf Latin district decided the 
candidates who could be considered to pastor local churches. After he informed the 
superintendent of his interest in pastoring, Espinoza was then surprised to discover 
that Templo Emanuel in Crystal City, Texas, had voted him in as pastor and that he 
was expected to report for duty after graduation in May 1971.

national convention in 1987. For six winters, they had helped in construction at Latin 
American Bible Institute in La Puente, California. 48 By the year 2003, RVers like the 
Matthews, Luithles, and Rhoads had saved more than $250 million in construction 
costs on a considerable variety of ministry projects and had fun and fellowship doing 
it. An important component of Mission America Placement Service, the RVers pro-
gram has proven to be successful beyond expectations.
To develop the program, General Superintendent G. Raymond Carlson invited 
Alaska pastor Patrick Donadio to Springfi  eld to head up the offi  ce. Donadio’s story, 
however, does not start with his successful church planting work in the forty-ninth 
state, but on the unpromising streets of Schenectady, New York, among the gangs. 
Although his Italian-American parents and brother and sister were eventually con-

[12] Although his Italian-American parents and brother and sister were eventually con-
verted and joined an Assemblies of God church, he resisted the gospel message, the 
authority of his parents, and the correction 
of school offi cials.
In his book Touch Me If You Dare!, Dona-
dio retraces his downward spiral from 
rebellion into crime and the increasing 
sorrow it brought to his family. Finally, 
while burglarizing a house in a resort area 
with other gang members, he was shot in 
the leg four times, but managed to escape. 
Although doctors informed him and his 
parents that they would need to ampu-
tate the leg, the circulation returned just 
before the scheduled surgery. “This is a miracle,” said the doctor. “His circulation is 
restored.”

Donadio’s life dramatically changed after that, and he enrolled at Pinecrest 
Bible Institute in Salisbury Center, New York, directed by N. J. Tavani. While there he 
bunked with Ed Spuler from New Jersey. He later married Spuler’s sister Ruth. Further 
study took the couple to Northeast Bible Institute in Green Lane, Pennsylvania (later 
Valley Forge Christian College in Phoenixville), and fi  nally to Central Bible College in 
Springfi eld, Missouri.
When Donadio heard missionary Arvin Glandon speak at Pinecrest on the need 
for more workers in Alaska, his heart was touched. “It’s one of the most primitive 
places in the entire world,” Glandon told the students. “You go to these places and 
there is nothing there. There are igloos made of sod, and conditions as primitive as 
in the prehistoric age.”

individual—on the desert road from Jerusalem to Gaza (Acts 8:26–40). “I  left the 
chapel service, unable to get past that picture: a man on fi  re for God, forsaking the 
masses to meet a single need,” recalled Donadio. “Back in my room, the veil of the 
Alaskans’ need descended on me, and I could not stop thinking and praying about 
a land I had only known as a . . . good place for hunting and fi  shing. It was prepos-

I answered, still fi lled with awe by the strangeness of it. “Yes, I will go,” my heart said 
to the Lord.”

Inaugurated by Paul Williams, M.D., in 1983, HCM has grown extensively in the 
scope of its operation. Doctors, dentists, nurses, and many other skilled volunteers 
donate their free time and pay their expenses. The linkage of medicine and prayer has 
met a vital need. When a team set up a weeklong clinic in El Bosque, Chile, they saw 
over 1,835 patients and more than 400 “prayed the sinner’s prayer.” Physical healings 
also occurred. On the fi  nal night, an evangelistic crusade began in a small storefront 
building. Fourteen months later, the congregation had grown to over four hundred 
members and was meeting in a new building.

called Chi Alpha (XA). As the program grew across the United States, it moved from cen-
tering on Assemblies of God students to recognizing the university as a strategic place 
for evangelism and discipleship. When C. David Gable became the national director of 
Chi Alpha in 1971, the endeavor blossomed in new ways through the addition of SALT 
(Student Activist Leadership Training) conferences, Institute of Campus Missions (after 
2000 known as Reach the University Institute), District Chi Alpha Directors Conference, 
and Campus Ministers Conference. Under his leadership, the ﬁ vefold Chi Alpha mission 
statement began to evolve that grounds the purpose of the organization in providing 
a campus community for worship, fellowship, discipleship, witness, and prayer. Over-
seas activities were launched when Jerry and Pat Sandidge pioneered University Action

With 221 Chi Alpha personnel having appointment as national U.S. missionaries 
in 2003, they could be found across the country on secular campuses. Along with its 
campus chapters, intensive discipleship-training program, and national conferences, 
the organization has begun to equip international students with skills for evangelism 
when they return to their home countries. In refl  ecting on both American and inter-
national students who have gone through the Chi Alpha program, veteran campus 
minister Joe Zickafoose stated: “Students I’ve seen who come through the fi  re of a

“Yes, but I  love Chi Alpha.” Not only had 
she found Christ, but a family of warm 
friends as well. Already the crossroads of 
global culture, universities have offered 
unique opportunities for ministry.
The work of Chi Alpha, which began 
in 1953, continued to fl  ourish under the 
administration of Dennis Gaylor, who suc-
ceeded C. David Gable in 1979 and has 
remained at the post. Familiar with the uni-
versity context, Gaylor had graduated from 
North Texas State Uni versity and completed 
an MA degree at the University of Houston. 
While serving as youth pastor at Lindale Assem bly of God in Houston, a campus min-
ister, Her schel Rosser, invited him to a Chi Alpha conference. This opened the eyes of 
Gaylor and his wife, Barbara, to the potential fruitfulness of such ministry. Following 
his own experience in campus min istry, he served as South Texas district’s Chi Alpha

By the year 2000, the world had become a global village. The long-cherished 
distinction between U.S. and foreign missions had blurred. Mission to the peoples of 
Colombia, Haiti, Nigeria, India, China, and the Pacifi  c Islands could be done in the 
cities of North America as well.

and university students were converted and discipled, they would evangelize in the 
far corners of the earth.
A former gang member, Patrick Donadio went on to pioneer churches in Alaska

[8] Espinoza grew up in poverty as an army brat. Determined to make something of his 
life, he earned an associate’s degree in science and then enrolled in the College of 
Pharmacy of the University of Houston. A scholarship and an offer of a career from 
a pharmaceutical company seemed to guarantee a bright future. “All this time,” he 
recalled, “I had been pushing aside a calling on my life. While I thought I had my 
future under control, I was unhappy, because life without 
a personal, nurturing relationship with God is harsh.”
Visiting his fi  ancé, Elois Patton, in San Antonio, he 
attended Sunday service at Highlands Assembly of God 
where he had a transforming spiritual experience: “This 
was the fi  rst and only time I  have danced in the Spirit, 
but after a prolonged experience in the presence of God,

study at the Latin American Bible Institute in Texas (then 
located in El Paso), he applied to the school, though he 
had lost his fl  uency in Spanish. After his freshman year, 
Efraim and Elois were married.
After graduation three years later, he felt prepared for 
ministry. In those years, the superintendent of the Gulf Latin district decided the 
candidates who could be considered to pastor local churches. After he informed the 
superintendent of his interest in pastoring, Espinoza was then surprised to discover 
that Templo Emanuel in Crystal City, Texas, had voted him in as pastor and that he 
was expected to report for duty after graduation in May 1971.

The awkwardness of Elois’s being an Anglo and not knowing Spanish did not help 
matters for them as a couple. Furthermore, Templo Emanuel had never had a pastor

national convention in 1987. For six winters, they had helped in construction at Latin 
American Bible Institute in La Puente, California. 48 By the year 2003, RVers like the 
Matthews, Luithles, and Rhoads had saved more than $250 million in construction 
costs on a considerable variety of ministry projects and had fun and fellowship doing 
it. An important component of Mission America Placement Service, the RVers pro-
gram has proven to be successful beyond expectations.
To develop the program, General Superintendent G. Raymond Carlson invited 
Alaska pastor Patrick Donadio to Springfi  eld to head up the offi  ce. Donadio’s story, 
however, does not start with his successful church planting work in the forty-ninth 
state, but on the unpromising streets of Schenectady, New York, among the gangs. 
Although his Italian-American parents and brother and sister were eventually con-

[12] Although his Italian-American parents and brother and sister were eventually con-
verted and joined an Assemblies of God church, he resisted the gospel message, the 
authority of his parents, and the correction 
of school offi cials.
In his book Touch Me If You Dare!, Dona-
dio retraces his downward spiral from 
rebellion into crime and the increasing 
sorrow it brought to his family. Finally, 
while burglarizing a house in a resort area 
with other gang members, he was shot in 
the leg four times, but managed to escape. 
Although doctors informed him and his 
parents that they would need to ampu-
tate the leg, the circulation returned just 
before the scheduled surgery. “This is a miracle,” said the doctor. “His circulation is 
restored.”

Donadio’s life dramatically changed after that, and he enrolled at Pinecrest

Donadio’s life dramatically changed after that, and he enrolled at Pinecrest 
Bible Institute in Salisbury Center, New York, directed by N. J. Tavani. While there he 
bunked with Ed Spuler from New Jersey. He later married Spuler’s sister Ruth. Further 
study took the couple to Northeast Bible Institute in Green Lane, Pennsylvania (later 
Valley Forge Christian College in Phoenixville), and fi  nally to Central Bible College in 
Springfi eld, Missouri.
When Donadio heard missionary Arvin Glandon speak at Pinecrest on the need 
for more workers in Alaska, his heart was touched. “It’s one of the most primitive 
places in the entire world,” Glandon told the students. “You go to these places and 
there is nothing there. There are igloos made of sod, and conditions as primitive as 
in the prehistoric age.”

“I felt a heaviness in my heart that I could not explain,” said Donadio, “and I could 
not make it go away as the missionary continued to speak.” Glandon used the story 
of Philip the evangelist to illustrate the value of someone leaving a large population

individual—on the desert road from Jerusalem to Gaza (Acts 8:26–40). “I  left the 
chapel service, unable to get past that picture: a man on fi  re for God, forsaking the 
masses to meet a single need,” recalled Donadio. “Back in my room, the veil of the 
Alaskans’ need descended on me, and I could not stop thinking and praying about 
a land I had only known as a . . . good place for hunting and fi  shing. It was prepos-
terous, yet so clear, so decisive, as the Holy Spirit prompted me to answer the call. 
I answered, still fi lled with awe by the strangeness of it. “Yes, I will go,” my heart said 
to the Lord.”

Years later, he could not escape the humor about the call: “It was only right,

You Can Be Healthy is an easy-to-read book on hygiene and nutrition being used 
in schools across Latin America and other parts of the world. It was written by JoAnn 
Butrin, director of HealthCare Ministries (HCM), the medical arm of Assemblies of 
God World Missions. Not only providing information on health education like You Can

Inaugurated by Paul Williams, M.D., in 1983, HCM has grown extensively in the

donate their free time and pay their expenses. The linkage of medicine and prayer has 
met a vital need. When a team set up a weeklong clinic in El Bosque, Chile, they saw 
over 1,835 patients and more than 400 “prayed the sinner’s prayer.” Physical healings 
also occurred. On the fi  nal night, an evangelistic crusade began in a small storefront 
building. Fourteen months later, the congregation had grown to over four hundred 
members and was meeting in a new building.

Henry Newman, who wrote on the nature of a Christian university, Ashcroft conceived 
of a Christian college as a community: “the communion, the relationship of scholars, 
those that had information and those that were seeking information.” To maximize 
the dynamic of such an enterprise, he added the Pentecostal dimension—a “Spirit 
awareness” that leads each one involved into taking all material, physical, and intel-
lectual resources and using them for spiritual ends. 
“Spiritual leadership is not managerial talent,” he said at a time when institu-
tional structures were fl  owering in the General Council. The model of the pastor 
and church leader increasingly resembled a CEO. Instead, said Ashcroft, it is to be 
marked by “God’s approval, with modesty, no self-aggrandizement.” To achieve this, 
“one must discover how to release [the love of Jesus] in the highest sense. This is 
beyond . . . the common human dimension. It is Calvary love.”

[20] that academic study of the Bible and theology will short-circuit ministry zeal. 
With growing interest in improving the quality of training in Assemblies of God 
Bible colleges by 1950, faculty members were encouraged to further their education. 
As a result, Bible and theology instructors began to earn specialized degrees in their 
areas of teaching. A younger generation of students revered teachers like Horton and 
Donald Johns (Central Bible College), who set a new standard of 
service in the church. The same was true for those teaching in the 
liberal arts, among them Alexander Vazakas (Evangel University), 
Klaude Kendrick (Southwestern Assemblies of God University), 
Marjorie Stewart (Northwest College), Betty Skipper (Southeast-
ern Col lege), and Everett Wilson (Bethany College). These were 
just some of the educational pioneers who early on pursued 
graduate studies with Pentecostal zeal.
Their achievements, however, do not diminish the import-

[21] local church and her outreaches, including the Bible Institute. That prayer has been 
answered many times over through the graduates of this school. Hal Donaldson, 
cofounder of Convoy of Hope, and Byron Klaus, current vice president at Evangel 
University and president of AGTS, are graduates. A great heritage and dedicated lead-
ers could not stem declining enrollment and increased indebtedness.
PROSPECTS FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
Several Alliance schools have experienced signifi  cant changes and growth in 
the past decade, each demonstrating integration of Pentecostal passion and aca-
demic excellence. Northwest University has added programs in nursing and graduate 
degrees in leadership. Southeastern University added several new building and pro-
grams, and more than three thousand total students by 2006. Southwestern Univer-
sity is another growing school, with new masters and doctoral programs. Zion Bible

531
9. SANCTIFICATION
Sanctifi cation is an act of separation from that which is evil, and of dedication 
unto God (Romans 12:1,2; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; Hebrews 13:12). Scriptures teach a 
life of “holiness without which no man shall see the Lord” (Hebrews 12:14). By the 
power of the Holy Spirit we are able to obey the command: “Be ye holy, for I am holy” 
(1 Peter 1:15,16).
Sanctifi cation is realized in the believer by recognizing his identifi  cation with 
Christ in His death and resurrection, and by faith reckoning daily upon the fact of that 
union, and by offering every faculty continually to the dominion of the Holy Spirit 
(Romans 6:1–11,13; 8:1,2,13; Galatians 2:20; Philippians 2:12,13; 1 Peter 1:5).
10. THE CHURCH AND ITS MISSION
The Church is the body of Christ, the habitation of God through the Spirit, with 
divine appointments for the fulfi  llment of her Great Commission. Each believer, born

[2] a. His virgin birth (Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:31,35). 
b. His sinless life (Hebrews 7:26; 1 Peter 2:22).
c. His miracles (Acts 2:22; 10:38).
d. His substitutionary work on the cross (1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
e. His bodily resurrection from the dead (Matthew 28:6; Luke 24:39; 1 Corinthians 
15:4).
f. His exaltation to the right hand of God (Acts 1:9,11; 2:33; Philippians 2:9–11; 
Hebrews 1:3).
4. THE FALL OF MAN
Man was created good and upright; for God said, “Let us make man in our 
image, after our likeness.” However, man by voluntary transgression fell and thereby 
incurred not only physical death but also spiritual death, which is separation from 
God (Genesis 1:26,27; 2:17; 3:6; Romans 5:12–19).
5. THE SALVATION OF MAN
Man’s only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son 
of God.

he Bible is our all–suffi  cient rule for faith and practice. This Statement of Fun-
damental Truths is intended simply as a basis of fellowship among us (i.e., that 
we all speak the same thing, 1 Corinthians 1:10; Acts 2:42). The phraseology 
employed in this statement is not inspired or contended for, but the truth set forth 
is held to be essential to a full–gospel ministry. No claim is made that it contains all 
biblical truth, only that it covers our need as to these fundamental doctrines.
1. THE SCRIPTURES INSPIRED
The Scriptures, both the Old and New Testaments, are verbally inspired of God 
and are the revelation of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and 
conduct (2 Timothy 3:15–17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Peter 1:21).
2. THE ONE TRUE GOD
The one true God has revealed himself as the eternally self–existent “I AM,” the 
Creator of heaven and earth and the Redeemer of mankind. He has further revealed

[4] salvation of all people; and 
 
10. avoid any nationalism or identity politics that elevates political identities and 
obscures a primary allegiance to Christ. Such conduct is divisive, potentially 
idolatrous, and leads away from the Assemblies of God’ s mission to evangelize 
the lost, worship God, disciple believers, and show compassion,  as expressed in 
Articles 10 and 11 of the Statement of Fundamental Truths.

of a generation of Assemblies of God “post-Pentecostal Pen-

mote Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues.
General Superintendent Wood disputes this pessimistic 
picture in a 2014 centennial interview in Charisma magazine. 
His observations, interviews with leaders, and wide travel

tongues is alive and growing. He affi  rmed that the statistics 
are imperfect, not refl  ecting practices in thousands of churches in recent years.

[6] notes a signifi cant rise in Pentecostal practices, even among those not tradition-
ally labeled Pentecostal or charismatic. For much the evangelical world in particular, 
praying for healing and miracles, exercising spiritual gifts, trusting the Lord for deliv-
erance, and speaking in tongues are all valid biblical practices. This is a signifi  cant 
change within one generation. 
Cessationism (the belief that the manifestations of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians 
12–14 ceased with the death of the original apostles or the close of the New Testa-
ment canon in the fourth century) is a declining movement as believers of all denom-
inations and theological persuasions affi  rm the contemporary work of the Spirit.

There are some signs across the United States that cause concern among 
thoughtful persons. The number of people that answered “none” when asked for reli-
gious affi  liation has grown from a miniscule percentage in the 1980s to 16.1  per-
cent in a 2007 poll by Pew Research. And 28 percent have left the faith they were 
raised in or affi  liate with no religion at all.
1 This refl  ects two trends: (1) the loss of 
denominational loyalty among some that might still (vaguely) identify themselves as 
Christians; and (2) an increasing number of the U.S. population (both immigrant and 
native-born) with no religious affi liation.

[8] “Post-Christian” and “postmodern” are labels tossed about with great frequency 
in popular analysis. The United States remains much more religious than most of 
Western Europe; however, “being spiritual and not religious” is gaining as a category 
of a generation without signifi  cant exposure to the gospel. 
The new challenge for Assemblies of God leaders is evangelization of people with 
no Christian memory. This is a new phenomenon for many U.S. leaders (though not 
for the appointed missionaries of AGWM).

consensus in the West and the United States of lifelong heterosexual marriage and 
celibacy for singles is no longer the prevailing opinion of popular culture or even 
a majority of people. While strong elements within American society advocate or 
support gay marriage, the Assemblies of God stands fi  rmly committed to scriptural 
teaching that marriage is between a man and a woman.
When confronted by actual or potential compromise in other evangelical or Pen-
tecostal fellowships and organizations, steadfast adherence to biblical marriage is 
quickly affi  rmed. The Assemblies of God leadership has been uncompromising it its 
standards of sexual conduct while affi  rming love for all people broken by sin.

[10] OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD!
The evangelical revivals of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries fueled the 
birth of global missions. The Pentecostal awakenings have accelerated the spread 
of the gospel in the twentieth century. We are now witnesses the re-evangelizing of 
Europe and the United States by missional believers from developing nations. The 
gospel is now going from everywhere to everywhere as former missions fi elds become 
missions-sending agencies. 
When Melvin Hodges penned The Indigenous Church in 1953, the aim of missions was 
a self-sustaining local church and, in the long-term, a self-sustaining national fellow-
ship. These remain important goals; however, a more complete goal is emerging in the 
twenty-fi rst century: establishing churches and fellowships of churches that become

the world answer the Great Commission call and become “360  Churches.” Mission-
ary-scholars such as Alan Johnson in Thailand are now articulating an integration of 
apostolic pioneering and church planting united with holistic care for communities. 
In the post-Christian West, Pentecostal spirituality and theology are the answer 
for generations that are hungry for experience and meaning rooted in love and truth. 
Apologetics and careful explanations of truth must be united with the proclamation 
of the Cross and power of the Spirit to deliver, heal, forgive, redeem, and transform.

[12] Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The 
signs and wonders demonstrated in Scripture are alive and well on the frontiers of 
evangelization and missions today. The Assemblies of God has a bright future as we 
recognize those frontiers across the street and around the world.
Gary McGee’s fi nal work, Miracles, Missions and American Pentecostalism (2010), details 
the supernatural confi rmation of the missionary pioneers. As a new Spirit-empowered 
generation hears the call to evangelism, worship, discipleship, and compassion, they 
can expect the Lord of the harvest to again confi  rm the message of grace.

relationship, as to its mode is inscrutable and incomprehensible, because unexplained 
(Luke 1:35; 1 Corinthians 1:24; Matthew 11:25–27; 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14; 1 John 1:3,4).
(c) Unity of the One Being of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
Accordingly, therefore, there is that in the Father which constitutes Him the Father 
and not the Son; there is that in the Son which constitutes Him the Son and not the 
Father; and there is that in the Holy Spirit which constitutes Him the Holy Spirit and 
not either the Father or the Son. Wherefore, the Father is the Begetter; the Son is the 
Begotten; and the Holy Spirit is the One proceeding from the Father and the Son. There-
fore, because these three persons in the godhead are in a state of unity, there is but 
one Lord God Almighty and His name one (John 1:18; 15:26; 17:11,21; Zechariah 14:9).
(d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor

[14] (d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor 
confused as to relation; nor divided in respect to the godhead; nor opposed as to 
cooperation. The Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son as to relationship. 
The Son is with the Father and the Father is with the Son, as to fellowship. The Father 
is not from the Son, but the Son is from the Father, as to authority. The Holy Spirit 
is from the Father and the Son proceeding, as to nature, relationship, cooperation, 
and authority. Hence, no person in the godhead either exists or works separately or 
independently of the others (John 5:17–30,32,37; 8:17,18).
(e) The Title, Lord Jesus Christ
The appellation Lord Jesus Christ, is a proper name. It is never applied in the New 
Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us

[15] Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us
The Lord Jesus Christ, as to His divine and eternal nature, is the proper and only 
Begotten of the Father, but as to His human nature, He is the proper Son of Man. He 
is, therefore, acknowledged to be both God and man; who because He is God and 
man, is “Immanuel,” God with us (Matthew 1:23; 1 John 4:2,10,14; Revelation 1:13,17).
(g) The Title, Son of God
Since the name Immanuel embraces both God and man, in the one person, our 
Lord Jesus Christ, it follows that the title Son of God describes His proper deity, and 
the title Son of Man, His proper humanity. Therefore, the title Son of God belongs to 
the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23; 
2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).

[16] the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23; 
2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).
(h) Transgression of the Doctrine of Christ
Wherefore, it is a transgression of the doctrine of Christ to say that Jesus Christ 
derived the title Son of God solely from the fact of the Incarnation, or because of His 
relation to the economy of redemption. Therefore, to deny that the Father is a real 
and eternal Father, and that the Son is a real and eternal Son, is a denial of the

a. Conditions to Salvation
Salvation is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord 
Jesus Christ. By the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, being 
justifi ed by grace through faith, man becomes an heir of God according to the hope of 
eternal life (Luke 24:47; John 3:3; Romans 10:13–15; Ephesians 2:8; Titus 2:11; 3:5–7).
b. The Evidences of Salvation
The inward evidence of salvation is the direct witness of the Spirit (Romans 8:16). 
The outward evidence to all men is a life of righteousness and true holiness (Ephe-
sians 4:24; Titus 2:12).
 6. THE ORDINANCES OF THE CHURCH
a. Baptism in Water
The ordinance of baptism by immersion is commanded in the Scriptures. All who 
repent and believe on Christ as Savior and Lord are to be baptized. Thus they declare 
to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with

[18] repent and believe on Christ as Savior and Lord are to be baptized. Thus they declare 
to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with 
Him to walk in newness of life (Matthew 28:19; Mark 16:16; Acts 10:47,48; Romans 6:4).
b. Holy Communion
The Lord’s Supper, consisting of the elements—bread and the fruit of the vine—is 
the symbol expressing our sharing the divine nature of our Lord Jesus Christ (2 Peter 
1:4); a memorial of His suffering and death (1 Corinthians 11:26); and a prophecy of His 
second coming (1 Corinthians 11:26); and is enjoined on all believers “till He come!”
7. THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
All believers are entitled to and should ardently expect and earnestly seek the 
promise of the Father, the baptism in the Holy Spirit and fi  re, according to the com-
mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the

[19] mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the 
bestowment of the gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry (Luke 24:49; Acts 
1:4,8; 1 Corinthians 12:1–31). This experience is distinct from and subsequent to the 
experience of the new birth (Acts 8:12–17; 10:44–46; 11:14–16; 15:7–9). With the bap-
tism in the Holy Spirit come such experiences as an overfl  owing fullness of the Spirit 
(John 7:37–39; Acts 4:8), a deepened reverence for God (Acts 2:43; Hebrews 12:28), an 
intensifi ed consecration to God and dedication to His work (Acts 2:42), and a more 
active love for Christ, for His Word, and for the lost (Mark 16:20).
8. THE INITIAL PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical 
sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts

[20] The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical 
sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts 
2:4). The speaking in tongues in this instance is the same in essence as the gift of 
tongues (1 Corinthians 12:4–10,28), but different in purpose and use.

11. THE MINISTRY
A divinely called and scripturally ordained ministry has been provided by our Lord 
for the fourfold purpose of leading the Church in: (1) evangelization of the world (Mark 
16:15–20), (2) worship of God (John 4:23,24), (3) building a Body of saints being per-
fected in the image of His Son (Ephesians 4:11,16), and (4) meeting human need with 
ministries of love and compassion (Psalm 112:9; Galatians 2:10; 6:10; James 1:27).
12. DIVINE HEALING
Divine healing is an integral part of the gospel. Deliverance from sickness is pro-
vided for in the Atonement, and is the privilege of all believers (Isaiah 53:4,5; Mat-
thew 8:16,17; James 5:14–16).
13. THE BLESSED HOPE
The resurrection of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and their translation 
together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).

[22] together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).
14. THE MILLENNIAL REIGN OF CHRIST
The second coming of Christ includes the rapture of the saints, which is our 
blessed hope, followed by the visible return of Christ with His saints to reign on 
the earth for one thousand years (Zechariah 14:5; Matthew 24:27,30; Revelation 1:7; 
19:11–14; 20:1–6). This millennial reign will bring the salvation of national Israel (Eze-
kiel 37:21,22; Zephaniah 3:19,20; Romans 11:26,27) and the establishment of univer-
sal peace (Isaiah 11:6–9; Psalm 72:3–8; Micah 4:3,4).
15. THE FINAL JUDGMENT
There will be a fi  nal judgment in which the wicked dead will be raised and judged 
according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to

[23] according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to 
everlasting punishment in the lake which burneth with fi  re and brimstone, which is 
the second death (Matthew 25:46; Mark 9:43–48; Revelation 19:20; 20:11–15; 21:8).
16. THE NEW HEAVENS AND THE NEW EARTH
“We, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein 
dwelleth righteousness” (2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 21,22).
Scripture quotations are from the King James Version of the Holy Bible.

Romans 13:7 argues to offer the state worship.  While Christians generally obey and 
submit to earthly authorities, earthly authorities are not absolutes. All submission occurs 
under the umbrella of Christian allegiance to God. His Person and kingdom cannot be 
compared with or subjected to any earthly power. 
 
Witness as Our Core Mission 
For the New Testament writers, being witnesses of God’s reconciling work in Christ is a 
core responsibility of believers . Anything that interferes with this work opposes the 
Christian faith, no matter the motivation. Acting in the name of Christ while  undermining 
the gospel’s presentation and the Church’s mission risks disobedience to Christ (Matthew 
28:19–20). Let it not be said of us that people blaspheme the name of God because of 
us (Romans 2:24). 
 
Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present

[27] us (Romans 2:24). 
 
Areas for such confusion are politics and civic engagement. Societal issues are complex 
and multifaceted. Some political and social entities demand allegiance and present  
simplistic answers that create us -vs-them scenarios . Desiring to make a positive 
difference in the world, well-meaning Christians often choose a side and universally adopt 
its stance on all the issues. In so doing, they can alienate others and damage their ability 
to witness to them. In a worst-case scenario, a chosen side might reveal itself as opposing 
Christian faith and virtue.  Christians must be careful in participating in any potentially 
harmful system that does not accurately represent Christ or His kingdom. 
 
Christians should ensure that their civic engagements are in harmony with their core 
task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere .

[28] task—representing Christ to the world.  Losing the ability to witness  is never worth the 
cost. This does not mean that C hristians should avoid politics or the public sphere . 
Believers should take moral stands on issues that matter to God. However, they should 
exercise caution and discernment in how they do so, living as wise agents of Christ ’s 
kingdom. 
 
Salt and Light 
One of Jesus’ best-known teachings contains dual metaphors for Christian engagement 
with the world. “You are the salt of the earth,” He said, and “You are the light of the world” 
(Matthew 5:13–14). In the right measure, salt improves what it touches. Similarly, 
Christians improve their environment. Consider this  test for valid Christian engagement: 
Does our influence make our environment better or worse? 
 
Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in

[29] Modern readers may more easily understand Jesus’ light metaphor. He said, “Let your 
light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in 
heaven” (Matthew 5:16). Jesus expects His followers to radiate goodness that dispels the 
darkness of evil . The light of their  good works point s to the Father —the Source of 
goodness. It elicits genuine praise for God from those who observe these acts of light . 
Consider another key test  for Christian engagement: Are people drawn to God by our 
public actions and disposition, or are they turned off?

[30] 6 
Love of God and Others 
Jesus was asked, “Of all the commandments, which is the most important?” (Mark 12:28). 
He offered a simple and comprehensive answer: Love God with all your being and love 
others as if they were you. Love is not an add-on; the characteristic of love defines those 
living an authentically Christian faith (John 13:35). 
 
First Corinthians 13 provides the best description of love in the Christian community. This 
list of love ’s characteristics mirrors actions in  every sphere of life, including public li fe. 
Biblical love raises another question: How does our participation in politics and other civic 
duties reflect the criteria of love, regardless of our intentions?  
 
The Role of the Holy Spirit  
All Christians should seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance when engaging in civic and political 
matters. Every aspect of Christian life depends on the Holy Spirit. As in the life of Jesus,

[31] All Christians should seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance when engaging in civic and political 
matters. Every aspect of Christian life depends on the Holy Spirit. As in the life of Jesus, 
the Holy Spirit must play a central role in guiding, facilitating, and empowering believers’ 
private and public lives. Christians engaged in the work of citizenship on their own risk 
the peril faced by the Galatians. They attempted to complete God’s work in the energy of 
the flesh (Galatians 3:3). We must also resist the urge to misuse a spiritual gift to earn  
political approval . To do so would make one no better than the court prophets  of 
Jeremiah’s day , who only prophesied in favor of the king. Are we living  as citizens  
according to the Spirit’s fruit and gifts (Galatians 5:22–23; 1 Corinthians 12, etc.)? 
 
Conclusion

[32] according to the Spirit’s fruit and gifts (Galatians 5:22–23; 1 Corinthians 12, etc.)? 
 
Conclusion 
 
Scripture does not single out one detailed model for Christian participation in civic and 
political spheres. As “the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and conduct,”
5 the Bible does 
offer powerful truths that should guide Christians ’ civic and political lives. T hroughout 
history, Christians have responded as best they could, in different political circumstances, 
as they sought to be faithful  to the Bible  in their unique contexts. From this important 
discussion comes the following summation for careful consideration. 
 
Believers must be mindful of their core identity as people of another kingdom. Allegiance 
to Christ as the only Lord and the defining role as His witnesses is crucial. As Christians 
act in love and as salt and light, under the guiding power of the Holy Spirit, they lead 
others to God, proclaim the gospel, and improve the world around them.

[33] act in love and as salt and light, under the guiding power of the Holy Spirit, they lead 
others to God, proclaim the gospel, and improve the world around them. 
 
Modern political movements are not centered around God’s destiny for humanity but 
rather focus on their ends. Further, they achieve those ends through power plays that 
rely on the successful domination of others rather than cooperation with the Holy Spirit. 
 
In practical terms, as followers of Christ and ministers of the gospel, we should:  
 
1. prioritize the gospel and its propagation far above personal and political 
allegiances;

[1] Its human and historical idealization is pictured in an oft-quoted passage from Israel’s “golden age”:  “During Solomon's lifetime Judah and Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, lived in safety (betach), everyone under their own vine and under their own fig tree” (1 Kings 4:25).  But as the biblical record makes clear, Solomon’s splendid and affluent kingdom by no means perfectly represented the mature shalom into which Israel’s God desired to bring His ancient covenant people and indeed all humankind (Micah 4:4).  Though the people whom God created were all too soon and too willingly alienated, the promise of a final and perfect realization of shalom is nonetheless found throughout the Scriptures.  Immediately following the Fall of our first parents is God’s promise that the seed of the woman would one day defeat the deceiver (Genesis 3:15).  This promise is followed by God’s promise to Abraham and his descendents that “all peoples on earth will be blessed through you” (Genesis 12:3).

[2] would one day defeat the deceiver (Genesis 3:15).  This promise is followed by God’s promise to Abraham and his descendents that “all peoples on earth will be blessed through you” (Genesis 12:3).  Somewhat later God promises that the Messiah, a descendant of David, will come to establish a kingdom of peace throughout the earth (2 Samuel 7:12–13; 1 Kings 8:20; 1 Chronicles 17:11–14; Isaiah 9:6–7; 11:10–16).  These conditions are beautifully and powerfully depicted in the Old Testament prophets as a time when nations will no longer war against one another (Isaiah 2:4) and all creation is at peace (Isaiah 32:17–18).  God’s people will then finally have entered into the perfect shalom He intended from the beginning.  With righteousness he [the Branch, i.e., the Messiah] will judge the needy, with justice he will give decisions for the poor of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth; with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked. Righteousness will be his belt

[3] with justice he will give decisions for the poor of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth; with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked. Righteousness will be his belt and faithfulness the sash around his waist. The wolf will live with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the goat, the calf and the lion and the yearling together; and a little child will lead them. The cow will feed with the bear, their young will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox. The infant will play near the cobra’s den, and the young child will put its hand into the viper’s nest. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain, for the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover the sea (Isaiah 11:4–9).  The New Testament continues this theme, often reflecting the language of the Old Testament prophets, and likewise declares that God’s eternal kingdom (Psalm 145:13) of peace will be established on the earth.  But it

[4] continues this theme, often reflecting the language of the Old Testament prophets, and likewise declares that God’s eternal kingdom (Psalm 145:13) of peace will be established on the earth.  But it will only come at the end of this present age when Jesus Christ returns as “King of kings and Lord of lords” (Revelation 19:11–16).  The Revelation vividly depicts the arrival of a millennium, a thousand-year reign of peace (Revelation 20:4–10) which then gives way to the new heaven and the new earth (Revelation 21).  It also describes the descent of the City of God at which time God comes eternally to dwell in righteousness and peace with His people (Revelation 21:1 through 22:5).   “Look!  God's dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them.  They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.  ‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes.  There will be no more death’

[5] or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.” (Revelation 21:3–4)  Present Need for Peacemaking  Unfortunately, from the fall of Adam and Eve until the present, peace on our fallen planet has continued to be fragile indeed.  Human history, to be sure, has its finer moments with the emergence of lofty ideals, many realized extensively in the history of our own and other nations, past and present.  But unfortunately human history is also littered with the memories of wars, tyrannical and corrupt regimes, lawlessness, murder, slavery, even genocide.  Far from our having evolved into a kinder, gentler world, the dawning of the twenty-first century is brimming with a simmering mix of ancient barbarities, militant religions, and godless philosophies that seem perennially to threaten whatever moral progress has been accomplished in previous generations.  Moral turbulence notwithstanding and with all the more reason, the Scriptures reiterate again and again the

[6] to threaten whatever moral progress has been accomplished in previous generations.  Moral turbulence notwithstanding and with all the more reason, the Scriptures reiterate again and again the imperative of peacemaking for every generation.  Dark ages and dark days are no reason for followers of Christ to cease faithful representation of the Prince of Peace!  Even so, with all realism, the New Testament anticipates that turmoil will continue, and indeed increase as the end of the age approaches.  In 2 Timothy 3:1–5, Paul predicts “terrible times” that will characterize many of the “last days.”  Among his descriptors of human depravity are such terms as “lovers of themselves (selfish),” “unforgiving,” and “treacherous,” all of which specifically identify characteristics that militate against peace and justice and often corrupt humankind’s best intended efforts toward those ends.  The Church in our time, and every time, has both the imperative and the challenge of pursuing peace and

[7] peace and justice and often corrupt humankind’s best intended efforts toward those ends.  The Church in our time, and every time, has both the imperative and the challenge of pursuing peace and justice in societies often tumultuous and conflicted.  Great revivals of Christian faith and morals have often turned the tide of human history, and that possibility is always with those who believe and act on their faith.  Biblical Directives for Peacemaking  The Scriptures are replete with directives to make peace in the midst of injustice and turmoil.  The Psalmist proclaims:  “Turn from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it” (Psalm 34:14).  The great writing prophets of the Old Testament severely condemned the dreadful social exploitation and injustice of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah in their prosperous but declining years.  Thus Amos confronted an outwardly religious but idolatrous and oppressive Israel:  Away with the noise of your songs! I will not listen to the music of your

[8] in their prosperous but declining years.  Thus Amos confronted an outwardly religious but idolatrous and oppressive Israel:  Away with the noise of your songs! I will not listen to the music of your harps. But let justice roll on like a river,  righteousness like a never-failing stream! (5:23–24).  Similarly, Isaiah shortly thereafter confronted Judah, also outwardly religious but publicly corrupted by injustice and idolatry:  Stop doing wrong. Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow (1:16–17).

[9] the prevailing materialist model, which explains our existence as the chance outcome of impersonal physical forces, leads to finding the value of life to be relative and incidental.  Our creation in God’s image is at the heart of the biblical injunction against murder: “Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made man” (Genesis 9:6). By placing His mark upon humankind, God clearly established His own authority over human life and holds accountable those who would usurp it.  The intrinsic value of human beings is confirmed by God’s expression of love in the sacrifice of His Son who paid the price for human sin and transgression. God rightly claims ownership of those He has purchased:  “Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God?

[10] the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price” (1 Corinthians 6:19,20).  Not only does God forbid the claims of others against our lives, He also forbids our own claims against our lives. Murder is condemned in the Bible in the severest terms (Genesis 9:6; Deuteronomy 5:17). Suicide, the deliberate killing of one’s self, finds no support in the Bible, and the few cases recorded there imply divine displeasure (1 Samuel 31:4; Matthew 27:5).  Advocates of suicide, by whatever means, must deny these standards and reject this valuation of human life. Specifically, they must contend for personal autonomy over one’s own existence. The argument is as follows:   “I am my own;  The time and means of my dying lie at the heart of my private life;  I therefore retain the ‘right to die’, and no-one may take it from me.”3  This assertion of personal sovereignty holds the promise of freedom but delivers self-destruction.  It

[11] of my private life;  I therefore retain the ‘right to die’, and no-one may take it from me.”3  This assertion of personal sovereignty holds the promise of freedom but delivers self-destruction.  It resonates with the falsity of Satan’s reasoning with Eve: “You will not surely die . . . For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil” (Genesis 3:4,5). As with any exercise of personal choice outside the parameters of God’s law—abortion, euthanasia, drug abuse, homosexual practices, and heterosexual promiscuity—the invariable consequence is physical and spiritual death.  Conversely, the righteous decision to obey God’s commands brings true freedom. Within the parameters of His law, the individual may anticipate the joy of His blessing. God confronts each of us with the stark alternatives: “This day I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose

[12] blessing. God confronts each of us with the stark alternatives: “This day I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live and that you may love the Lord your God, listen to his voice, and hold fast to him” (Deuteronomy 30:19,20).

[13] The Boundaries of Life God determines the boundaries of life and holds in His hands the two fragile ends of human experience. He is active in the conception of life and the conclusion of life, in birth and in death.  Of his beginning, the Psalmist writes, “For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb. . . . My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place” (Psalm 139:13,15). The womb is the place of God’s creative handiwork. It is there each life is endowed with unique personality, unique physical traits, and a unique spiritual nature. The glimpses we have seen of this work through the eyes of biomedical advance only intensify our awe at God’s techniques. We may be less discerning, on the other hand, of God’s activity in the final moments of death. We naturally shrink from death and view it as an adversary reluctantly yielding, in the end, to its inexorable demand upon us.  Of course, death was not God’s ideal. Death was introduced by

[14] of death. We naturally shrink from death and view it as an adversary reluctantly yielding, in the end, to its inexorable demand upon us.  Of course, death was not God’s ideal. Death was introduced by rebellion and subsequently spread from one man to the entire race: “Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin . . . in this way death came to all men, because all sinned” (Romans 5:12). God’s plan is to deliver us from this last enemy. “ ‘Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?’ The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Corinthians 15:55–57).  For the believer, death is not a final defeat but a transition in which the perishable is exchanged for the imperishable, the temporal for the eternal, the imperfect for the perfect. The believer experiences assurance even when facing death. Job concludes, “You will call and I will answer

[15] exchanged for the imperishable, the temporal for the eternal, the imperfect for the perfect. The believer experiences assurance even when facing death. Job concludes, “You will call and I will answer you; you will long for the creature your hands have made” (Job 14:15). The Psalmist implies the symmetry of God’s activity in his birth and death when he writes, “All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be” (Psalm 139:16).  If life’s beginning at conception and life’s end at death are in God’s hands, both abortion and suicide, assisted or otherwise, represent violations of His prerogative. Abortion steals from the womb a life yet to be started; suicide hastens to the grave a life yet to be completed.  The argument for suicide also ignores the profound spiritual implications of the transition from life to death. Its proponents and practitioners offer no insights into the spiritual reality beyond the grave. There is no acknowledgment of mortality or

[16] spiritual implications of the transition from life to death. Its proponents and practitioners offer no insights into the spiritual reality beyond the grave. There is no acknowledgment of mortality or final judgment. This apparent naiveté is indicative of the spiritual deception underlying the right-to-die philosophy. The Meaning of Suffering Our difficulty in understanding God’s activity in death is matched only by our difficulty understanding His activity in human suffering. From the biblical perspective, however, suffering is potentially purposeful and refining. From the perspective of the proponents of

[17] Healings also helped to identify Jesus as the promised Messiah and Savior. Jesus fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah 53:4: “Surely he took up [lifted and took away] our infirmities and carried [as a heavy load] our sorrows.” (“Infirmities,” choli, is the same word used of physical sickness and disease in Deuteronomy 28:59,61; 2 Chronicles 16:12; 21:15,18,19; Isaiah 38:9. “Sorrows,” makob, is the same word used of physical pain in Job 33:19.) Matthew, in the account of Jesus’ healing of Peter’s mother-in-law, sees this Isaiah passage fulfilled in the healing ministry of Jesus: “This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: ‘He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases’ ” (Matthew 8:17).2  Isaiah also ties the sufferings of the Servant to the provision of salvation, a ministry fulfilled by Jesus (Isaiah 53:5,6). His sufferings were for our sins and lead to our peace with God: “And by his wounds we are healed” (Isaiah 53:5). The Isaiah context and the reference to

[18] ministry fulfilled by Jesus (Isaiah 53:5,6). His sufferings were for our sins and lead to our peace with God: “And by his wounds we are healed” (Isaiah 53:5). The Isaiah context and the reference to it in 1 Peter 2:24,25 emphasize especially the healing or restoration from sin. However, in view of the emphasis on physical sickness in Isaiah 53:4, it is clear that these passages teach that the gospel to be introduced by the Suffering Servant, Jesus, includes healing from both the spiritual and physical effects of the fall of the human race into sin recorded in Genesis 3.  When John the Baptist was imprisoned, he questioned whether Jesus was actually the promised Messiah or just another forerunner like himself. Jesus responded by calling attention to His messianic works that linked miracles and the preaching of the gospel to the poor (Matthew 11:4,5). Again, healing was an important witness, an integral part of the gospel (Isaiah 61:1,2; Luke 4:18; 7:19–23).  Divine healing continued to

[19] and the preaching of the gospel to the poor (Matthew 11:4,5). Again, healing was an important witness, an integral part of the gospel (Isaiah 61:1,2; Luke 4:18; 7:19–23).  Divine healing continued to be an integral part of the gospel through the ministry of the apostles and the Early Church. Jesus sent out the Twelve and the Seventy-two to preach and to heal the sick (Luke 9:2; 10:9). After Pentecost “many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles” (Acts 2:43). Luke wrote the Book of Acts as an extension of the story of what Jesus did and taught, not only through the apostles but through a Church filled with the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:1,8; 2:4).  The working of miracles, including divine healing, was not limited to the apostles. The promise of Jesus was to all believers (John 14:12–14) who would ask in His name (that is, those who recognize His authority and conform themselves to His nature and purposes). God used deacons such as Philip to preach and heal (Acts 8:5–7) and an

[20] who would ask in His name (that is, those who recognize His authority and conform themselves to His nature and purposes). God used deacons such as Philip to preach and heal (Acts 8:5–7) and an otherwise unknown disciple, Ananias, to bring healing to Saul (Paul) (Acts 9:12–18).  The gospel message includes the provision of spiritual gifts through the Holy Spirit to the Church, among which are the gifts of healings (1 Corinthians 12:7). All of these gifts, including that of healing, continue to edify or build up the Church and offer hope to every believer. Moreover, James asserts that healing is a normal aspect of the regular meetings of the Church. Whenever the community of faith is gathered, anyone who is sick may                                                  2 “Infirmities,” astheneia, denotes weakness and is often used to speak of sickness and disease (Luke 5:15; Acts 28:9); “Diseases,” nosos, seems to be used synonymously with astheneia here to indicate physical disease or

[21] denotes weakness and is often used to speak of sickness and disease (Luke 5:15; Acts 28:9); “Diseases,” nosos, seems to be used synonymously with astheneia here to indicate physical disease or illness (see also, Matthew 4:23; 9:35; Luke 7:21; Acts 19:12).

[22] request prayer for healing (5:14). We are assured that divine healing is an ongoing manifestation of the gospel in the current day, and will continue until the return of Jesus. II. Divine Healing Is Provided in the Atonement The ministry of the priests under the Law foreshadowed the ministry of the great High Priest, Jesus Christ, who is able “to sympathize with our weaknesses (astheneia, weakness, sickness, disease, timidity, infirmity)” (Hebrews 4:14,15). The Old Testament priests, through the sprinkling of the blood of the sacrifices, made atonement for the sins of the people.  An examination of the concept of atonement in the Bible shows that in most cases it refers to a ransom price paid for redemption and restoration, which points to the redemption through Christ accomplished by the shedding of His blood in our behalf. The apostle Paul described it this way: “God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood” (Romans 3:25).  The phrase, “sacrifice of

[23] the shedding of His blood in our behalf. The apostle Paul described it this way: “God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood” (Romans 3:25).  The phrase, “sacrifice of atonement,” translates the Greek hilastērion, which can be also translated expiation, propitiation, atonement, or mercy seat. Leviticus 16 records God’s expectations for Israel’s Day of Atonement and the ministry of the high priest sprinkling the blood of a sin offering on the atonement cover (the solid gold lid on top of the ark of the covenant). The ark contained the stone tablets of the Law, which the people had broken. The broken Law called for judgment and death. But when the blood of a spotless lamb was sprinkled, prophetically anticipating the sinless life of Christ, God saw that sinless life instead of the broken Law and could give mercy and blessing.  The primary purpose of the atonement was cleansing from sin (Leviticus 16:30). It is also clear, however, that atonement brought

[24] life instead of the broken Law and could give mercy and blessing.  The primary purpose of the atonement was cleansing from sin (Leviticus 16:30). It is also clear, however, that atonement brought release from the penalty and consequences of sin in order to bring restoration to God’s blessing and favor. When the people of Israel complained after the judgment that followed the rebellion of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, God sent a plague on the Israelites. Moses sent Aaron out into the midst of the congregation, where he made atonement for them, and the plague was stopped (Numbers 16:47,48). The Law of Moses required that when the men of Israel were numbered, they were each to give a half shekel atonement offering for their redemption and to prevent a plague from coming upon them (Exodus 30:11–16). Atonement thus provided cleansing from sin and its consequences, including sickness and disease.  The Bible makes it clear that people could not pay the price for their redemption, so God out of

[25] Atonement thus provided cleansing from sin and its consequences, including sickness and disease.  The Bible makes it clear that people could not pay the price for their redemption, so God out of His love and for the glory of His own name provided the ultimate atonement (Romans 3:25; see also Psalms 65:3; 78:38; 79:9; Romans 3:21–28). All this was accomplished through Christ at Calvary (John 3:14–16). There He made a full atonement for the whole person. The New Testament speaks of this as redemption, which has essentially the same meaning as atonement. Through Christ we have received redemption and the forgiveness of sins (Romans 3:24; Ephesians 1:7; Colossians 1:14; Hebrews 9:15).

[26] The Problem of Gambling  The prevalence of gambling has increased as a result of its accelerated legalization3, enhanced media exposure through mega-lotteries, expanded accessibility through online gaming and state-sanctioned lotteries, perceived acceptability of “gaming” as healthy social activity and recreational entertainment, and professed claims of economic benefit through job creation. Nonetheless, gambling’s troublesome consequences, both individual and societal, remain.  For many persons gambling results in psychological addiction4 that mirrors other forms of addiction, such as alcohol and drug dependence, in terms of symptoms5 and variation in brain chemistry.6 Gambling’s threat to public health is understood in terms of its susceptibility to organized criminal influence and control, as well as its detrimental impact on society in terms of marital dissolutions7, impoverished families, bankruptcies, suicides8 and costs of associated social services, such as treating addictions

[27] as well as its detrimental impact on society in terms of marital dissolutions7, impoverished families, bankruptcies, suicides8 and costs of associated social services, such as treating addictions and responding to increased crime.  In the social sciences, the term “gambling disorders” incorporates both “problem gambling” and “pathological gambling,”9 the latter being the more severe and subject to clinical diagnosis. Researchers spanning three decades estimate that from slightly less than 1 percent up to 1.9 percent of the U. S. general population suffers from pathological gambling.10 In a meta-analysis of 120 previous studies, researchers at the Center for Addictions at Harvard Medical School found that approximately 1.1 percent of the adult general population were past-year level three [pathological] gamblers and an additional 2.8 percent were classified as level 2 [problematic] gamblers who were having some problems as a result of their gambling but did not meet diagnostic criteria

[28] gamblers and an additional 2.8 percent were classified as level 2 [problematic] gamblers who were having some problems as a result of their gambling but did not meet diagnostic criteria as pathological.11 This research suggests that almost 4 percent of the adult population in the United States suffers from some form of gambling disorder. Of the pathological gamblers, approximately 75 percent have an alcohol use disorder and 38 percent also

People can get into trouble with all types of gambling, from sports betting to the lottery, from bingo to casino games.”14 This should serve as a warning even to many good and relatively psychologically healthy people, including Christians, who “have been ‘softened’ toward frequent gambling by the permissive attitudes of family or friends, and by

[33] even to many good and relatively psychologically healthy people, including Christians, who “have been ‘softened’ toward frequent gambling by the permissive attitudes of family or friends, and by favorable portrayals of betting in popular culture. They start gambling for entertainment, or to be sociable. . . . From that point, the conditioning process takes over, forging a connection in the brain between winning and feeling good.”15  While all levels of society may be adversely affected by gambling, repeated studies have shown that the poor are particularly susceptible to the inducements of the industry, and are deliberately targeted.16 State-sponsored lotteries likewise generate much of their revenue from the less affluent who are often desperate for a solution to their financial ills and more easily drawn in by lottery advertising.17 That those at or near the poverty level spend a greater percentage of their income on various gambling venues is well documented. One recent study by a

[34] more easily drawn in by lottery advertising.17 That those at or near the poverty level spend a greater percentage of their income on various gambling venues is well documented. One recent study by a major university institute found that problem gambling was twice as common in “disadvantaged” neighborhoods as the more affluent. Moreover, the poorest in these disadvantaged neighborhoods were the ones at greatest risk for gambling problems.18  Given these problematic effects of gambling upon individuals, governmental reliance upon state-sanctioned gambling to fund its legitimate activities such as education is deplorable. Furthermore, marketing and promotion of state-sanctioned gambling—which amounts to a tax (though voluntary) upon those in society who can least afford to pay the monetary and social penalties accompanying such gambling—is especially egregious.

9. SANCTIFICATION
Sanctifi cation is an act of separation from that which is evil, and of dedication 
unto God (Romans 12:1,2; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; Hebrews 13:12). Scriptures teach a 
life of “holiness without which no man shall see the Lord” (Hebrews 12:14). By the 
power of the Holy Spirit we are able to obey the command: “Be ye holy, for I am holy” 
(1 Peter 1:15,16).
Sanctifi cation is realized in the believer by recognizing his identifi  cation with 
Christ in His death and resurrection, and by faith reckoning daily upon the fact of that 
union, and by offering every faculty continually to the dominion of the Holy Spirit 
(Romans 6:1–11,13; 8:1,2,13; Galatians 2:20; Philippians 2:12,13; 1 Peter 1:5).

divine appointments for the fulfi  llment of her Great Commission. Each believer, born

T
he Bible is our all–suffi  cient rule for faith and practice. This Statement of Fun-
damental Truths is intended simply as a basis of fellowship among us (i.e., that 
we all speak the same thing, 1 Corinthians 1:10; Acts 2:42). The phraseology 
employed in this statement is not inspired or contended for, but the truth set forth 
is held to be essential to a full–gospel ministry. No claim is made that it contains all 
biblical truth, only that it covers our need as to these fundamental doctrines.
1. THE SCRIPTURES INSPIRED
The Scriptures, both the Old and New Testaments, are verbally inspired of God 
and are the revelation of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and 
conduct (2 Timothy 3:15–17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Peter 1:21).
2. THE ONE TRUE GOD
The one true God has revealed himself as the eternally self–existent “I AM,” the 
Creator of heaven and earth and the Redeemer of mankind. He has further revealed

[3] a. His virgin birth (Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:31,35). 
b. His sinless life (Hebrews 7:26; 1 Peter 2:22).
c. His miracles (Acts 2:22; 10:38).
d. His substitutionary work on the cross (1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
e. His bodily resurrection from the dead (Matthew 28:6; Luke 24:39; 1 Corinthians 
15:4).
f. His exaltation to the right hand of God (Acts 1:9,11; 2:33; Philippians 2:9–11; 
Hebrews 1:3).
4. THE FALL OF MAN
Man was created good and upright; for God said, “Let us make man in our 
image, after our likeness.” However, man by voluntary transgression fell and thereby 
incurred not only physical death but also spiritual death, which is separation from 
God (Genesis 1:26,27; 2:17; 3:6; Romans 5:12–19).
5. THE SALVATION OF MAN
Man’s only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son 
of God.

[4] we preach the doctrine of hell. 
Do not allow the details to detract from the main thing. 
Prophetic predictions, charts, and debates about the details can be interesting. 
However, they are often a distraction from the main message. It is im portant not to let 
debatable details distract from the important c ore belief in Christ’s coming. The 
imminent return of Jesus  motivates, encourages, and unites us in our mission.  
Show charity to other believers in disagreements over eschatology. 
The Assemblies of God has defined the boundaries of its eschatology with the 
formulation of the Statement of Fundamental Truths. However, the Statement of 
Fundamental Truths does not set the boundaries for being a Christian. We 
recognize that Christians  can d isagree on matters that are not essential to salvation, 
even if it involves the interpretation of Scripture. Eschatology matters, but not all 
Christians hold the same beliefs about eschatology. God has called all Christians to

premillennial eschatology overall. As a Fellowship, we should have charity among 
our ranks about such debated issues and not divide ov er nonessentials not clearly 
stated in our Fundamental Truths. 
Fundamental Truths 13 and 14 
The Assemblies of God’s doc trinal statements about the rapture of the Church and 
Christ’s second coming ar e supported by various Scriptures that are im portant to 
the premillennial emphasis. Titus 2:13, 9 which says, “We wait for the blessed hope
—the appearing of the glory of our  great God and Savior, J esus Christ,” is the 
basis for Fundamental Truth 13. Paul’s hope was that Christ will reward all thos e who 
“have longed for his appearing” (2 Timothy 4:8). Additionally, Paul stated that when 
Christ comes, His coming will be announced with a “loud comm and” and a “trum pet 
call,” and believers on earth will be “caught up together with them in the clouds to 
meet the Lord in the air.”  (1 Thessalonians 4:16–1 7). This “Rapture” or “translation”

[6] call,” and believers on earth will be “caught up together with them in the clouds to 
meet the Lord in the air.”  (1 Thessalonians 4:16–1 7). This “Rapture” or “translation” 
of the saints emphasizes the resurrection of the body and the welcoming of Jes us into 
His kingdom by His saints. Paul’s admonition in 1 Corinthians 15:51–5 4 fortifies this 
teaching which promises that “in the twinkling of an eye,” our bodies will be “changed,” 
and death is “swallowed up in vic tory.” Paul’s writing reminds us that if there is no 
resurrection, then “our preaching is useless and so is your faith” (1 Corinthians  15:13–
14). Though there are debates about when this will occur in relation to the Tribulation, 
it is clear that Jesus’ ultimate destination is His kingdom  on the earth.

[7] Fundamental Truth 14, “The Millennial Reign of Christ,” lists several v erses 
supporting Jesus’ return to reign on the earth for a thousand years befor e the final 
judgment. The Assemblies of God has held that a premillennial interpretation of 
Revelation 20 is the most natural reading of the text, as it does justice to the details of 
the narrative and best fits with other passages of Scripture regarding the imminent 
return of Jesus. It als o holds that such an interpretation gives space for God to fulfill 
promises to the people of Israel.  
A common messianic expectation of the Kingdom—t he premillennial return of Jesus— 
is throughout Scripture, not only in Revelation 20. Its roots are in the belief in 
the premillennial return of Jes us. When Jesus ascended to heaven, the angel 
promised that “this same Jesus . . . will come back in the same way you have seen him 
go into heaven” (Acts 1:11). Just as His followers saw Him leave, everyone will see Him

[8] promised that “this same Jesus . . . will come back in the same way you have seen him 
go into heaven” (Acts 1:11). Just as His followers saw Him leave, everyone will see Him 
coming in clouds of glory back to earth (Matthew 24:30; Rev elation 1:7). Zechariah 
prophesied that the Lord will come and His “holy ones with him” (Zechariah 14:5). 
Paul referred to Chr ist’s earthly reign when he wrote, “He m ust reign until he has put 
all his enemies under his  feet” (1 Corinthians 15:25). In this kingdom, even the 
created order will come under His  peaceful rule as “the wolf will live with the lamb,” 
and creation will be in harmony (Isaiah 11:6–7 ).

Fundamental Truth 14 also affirms that Jesus’ com ing includes a future for  Israel. 
Drawing from Paul’s prom ise that “all Israel will be saved” (Romans 11:26–27), it 
notes that the reign of Chr ist will mean the “ salvation of national Israel.” In 
affirming this, it does not mean that Jewish people today do not need Chr ist as 
Savior and Messiah. The A ssemblies of God has long emphasized evangelis m 
among the Jewish people. This line affirms that Christ’s future messianic k ingdom 
will bring salvation to Jewis h people as promis ed in the Old Testament bec ause 
they will accept Jesus as M essiah.  
While respecting that other Bible-b elieving traditions may interpret the Millennium 
in different ways, the Assemblies of God has always held that premillennialism best 
affirms the core beliefs in the imminent return of Christ, the resurrection of the 
Church, the fulfillment of biblical pr omises r egarding the mes sianic kingdom, and all

[11] affirms the core beliefs in the imminent return of Christ, the resurrection of the 
Church, the fulfillment of biblical pr omises r egarding the mes sianic kingdom, and all 
other events leading to a renewed creation (Revelation 21–22). The Church bears 
witness to the reign of Christ but must never act as if it is the reign of Christ on the earth. 
Whenever the Church has assumed power in place of Christ, the r esult has been a 
historic disaster for  the witness of the gospel. 
Guidance for Pastors 
The doctrines of the Blessed Hope and the millennial reign ar e essential pillars of 
our Assemblies of God doctr ine. For generations , the Holy Spirit has  inspired 
believers to expect and long for the imminent return of Christ. This belief has 
motivated reaching the lost, launching ministries, and sending m issionaries to the 
ends of the earth to reach people for Chr ist.  
Unfortunately, our long his tory of focusing on the end times includes unhealthy

[12] ends of the earth to reach people for Chr ist.  
Unfortunately, our long his tory of focusing on the end times includes unhealthy 
prophetic speculation. End-t ime controversies and failed predictions have led to 
exhaustion in some ministers, discouraging them from preaching about eschatology. At 
times, pastors have avoided the topic altogether rather than face the minefield of 
divergent eschatological beliefs. There is a great danger that ministers and teac hers 
may be avoiding one of the Assemblies of God’s distinctive doctrines altogether. 
Eschatology is too important to allow the extremes of spec ulation or outright neglect to 
determine our message. B ecause of this, we recom mend the following. 
Trust in the Bible’s promise that Jesus is coming again. 
There are many ways to interpret Scripture, but the truth of His coming and the 
future resurrection is a divine promise from a God who does not lie. Throughout church

[13] There are many ways to interpret Scripture, but the truth of His coming and the 
future resurrection is a divine promise from a God who does not lie. Throughout church 
history, the creeds and doctr ines of orthodox  Christianity have affirmed this belief. It 
remains a core belief of the A ssemblies of God. 
Focus on the hope of Christ’s coming. 
We call His coming “the Blessed Hope” because of our hope that Christ will raise us 
from the dead. We have hope that Christ will reverse the injustice and sin of the world 
when He establishes His kingdom of peace on earth. Our world needs this hope. Our 
ministers can use our eschatological doctrines to preach hope in our churches.

[14] gifts, and healing without the universality of Spirit baptism 
and tongues. There is a real danger, in the words of Earl Creps, 
of a generation of Assemblies of God “post-Pentecostal Pen-
tecostals” that affi  rm the Statement of Fundamental Truths 
and enjoy relationships, but do not seek to practice or pro-
mote Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues.
General Superintendent Wood disputes this pessimistic 
picture in a 2014 centennial interview in Charisma magazine. 
His observations, interviews with leaders, and wide travel 
affi rm that Spirit baptism with the initial physical evidence of 
tongues is alive and growing. He affi  rmed that the statistics 
are imperfect, not refl  ecting practices in thousands of churches in recent years.
A recent Pew Research study evaluating both American and global Christianity 
notes a signifi cant rise in Pentecostal practices, even among those not tradition-
ally labeled Pentecostal or charismatic. For much the evangelical world in particular,

[15] notes a signifi cant rise in Pentecostal practices, even among those not tradition-
ally labeled Pentecostal or charismatic. For much the evangelical world in particular, 
praying for healing and miracles, exercising spiritual gifts, trusting the Lord for deliv-
erance, and speaking in tongues are all valid biblical practices. This is a signifi  cant 
change within one generation. 
Cessationism (the belief that the manifestations of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians 
12–14 ceased with the death of the original apostles or the close of the New Testa-
ment canon in the fourth century) is a declining movement as believers of all denom-
inations and theological persuasions affi  rm the contemporary work of the Spirit. 
Though many of these groups do not share the “classical” Pentecostal distinctive 
of tongues as the initial physical evident of Spirit baptism, the affi  rmation that the 
Spirit works in and through all the gifts is a heartening change.

[16] of tongues as the initial physical evident of Spirit baptism, the affi  rmation that the 
Spirit works in and through all the gifts is a heartening change. 
There are some signs across the United States that cause concern among 
thoughtful persons. The number of people that answered “none” when asked for reli-
gious affi  liation has grown from a miniscule percentage in the 1980s to 16.1  per-
cent in a 2007 poll by Pew Research. And 28 percent have left the faith they were 
raised in or affi  liate with no religion at all.
1 This refl  ects two trends: (1) the loss of 
denominational loyalty among some that might still (vaguely) identify themselves as 
Christians; and (2) an increasing number of the U.S. population (both immigrant and 
native-born) with no religious affi liation.

[17] “Post-Christian” and “postmodern” are labels tossed about with great frequency 
in popular analysis. The United States remains much more religious than most of 
Western Europe; however, “being spiritual and not religious” is gaining as a category 
of a generation without signifi  cant exposure to the gospel. 
The new challenge for Assemblies of God leaders is evangelization of people with 
no Christian memory. This is a new phenomenon for many U.S. leaders (though not 
for the appointed missionaries of AGWM). 
Another concern among thoughtful adherents is moral compromise with the 
subversion of traditional marriage and sexuality in the last half-century. The public

consensus in the West and the United States of lifelong heterosexual marriage and 
celibacy for singles is no longer the prevailing opinion of popular culture or even 
a majority of people. While strong elements within American society advocate or 
support gay marriage, the Assemblies of God stands fi  rmly committed to scriptural 
teaching that marriage is between a man and a woman.
When confronted by actual or potential compromise in other evangelical or Pen-
tecostal fellowships and organizations, steadfast adherence to biblical marriage is 
quickly affi  rmed. The Assemblies of God leadership has been uncompromising it its 
standards of sexual conduct while affi  rming love for all people broken by sin.

[19] OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD!
The evangelical revivals of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries fueled the 
birth of global missions. The Pentecostal awakenings have accelerated the spread 
of the gospel in the twentieth century. We are now witnesses the re-evangelizing of 
Europe and the United States by missional believers from developing nations. The 
gospel is now going from everywhere to everywhere as former missions fi elds become 
missions-sending agencies. 
When Melvin Hodges penned The Indigenous Church in 1953, the aim of missions was 
a self-sustaining local church and, in the long-term, a self-sustaining national fellow-
ship. These remain important goals; however, a more complete goal is emerging in the 
twenty-fi rst century: establishing churches and fellowships of churches that become 
not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around

[20] not only self-sustaining, but missionary sending. Fresh voices such as Ivan Satyavrata, 
Wonsuk and Julie Ma, DeLonn Rance, and others are helping AG adherents around 
the world answer the Great Commission call and become “360  Churches.” Mission-
ary-scholars such as Alan Johnson in Thailand are now articulating an integration of 
apostolic pioneering and church planting united with holistic care for communities. 
In the post-Christian West, Pentecostal spirituality and theology are the answer 
for generations that are hungry for experience and meaning rooted in love and truth. 
Apologetics and careful explanations of truth must be united with the proclamation 
of the Cross and power of the Spirit to deliver, heal, forgive, redeem, and transform. 
Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The 
signs and wonders demonstrated in Scripture are alive and well on the frontiers of

[21] Now is not the time to lessen Pentecostal emphases. The exact opposite is true. The 
signs and wonders demonstrated in Scripture are alive and well on the frontiers of 
evangelization and missions today. The Assemblies of God has a bright future as we 
recognize those frontiers across the street and around the world.
Gary McGee’s fi nal work, Miracles, Missions and American Pentecostalism (2010), details 
the supernatural confi rmation of the missionary pioneers. As a new Spirit-empowered 
generation hears the call to evangelism, worship, discipleship, and compassion, they 
can expect the Lord of the harvest to again confi  rm the message of grace.

relationship, as to its mode is inscrutable and incomprehensible, because unexplained 
(Luke 1:35; 1 Corinthians 1:24; Matthew 11:25–27; 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14; 1 John 1:3,4).
(c) Unity of the One Being of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
Accordingly, therefore, there is that in the Father which constitutes Him the Father 
and not the Son; there is that in the Son which constitutes Him the Son and not the 
Father; and there is that in the Holy Spirit which constitutes Him the Holy Spirit and 
not either the Father or the Son. Wherefore, the Father is the Begetter; the Son is the 
Begotten; and the Holy Spirit is the One proceeding from the Father and the Son. There-
fore, because these three persons in the godhead are in a state of unity, there is but 
one Lord God Almighty and His name one (John 1:18; 15:26; 17:11,21; Zechariah 14:9).
(d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor

[23] (d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor 
confused as to relation; nor divided in respect to the godhead; nor opposed as to 
cooperation. The Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son as to relationship. 
The Son is with the Father and the Father is with the Son, as to fellowship. The Father 
is not from the Son, but the Son is from the Father, as to authority. The Holy Spirit 
is from the Father and the Son proceeding, as to nature, relationship, cooperation, 
and authority. Hence, no person in the godhead either exists or works separately or 
independently of the others (John 5:17–30,32,37; 8:17,18).
(e) The Title, Lord Jesus Christ
The appellation Lord Jesus Christ, is a proper name. It is never applied in the New 
Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us

[24] Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively 
to the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3,7; 2 John 3).
(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God With Us
The Lord Jesus Christ, as to His divine and eternal nature, is the proper and only 
Begotten of the Father, but as to His human nature, He is the proper Son of Man. He 
is, therefore, acknowledged to be both God and man; who because He is God and 
man, is “Immanuel,” God with us (Matthew 1:23; 1 John 4:2,10,14; Revelation 1:13,17).
(g) The Title, Son of God
Since the name Immanuel embraces both God and man, in the one person, our 
Lord Jesus Christ, it follows that the title Son of God describes His proper deity, and 
the title Son of Man, His proper humanity. Therefore, the title Son of God belongs to 
the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23; 
2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).

[25] the order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23; 
2 John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).
(h) Transgression of the Doctrine of Christ
Wherefore, it is a transgression of the doctrine of Christ to say that Jesus Christ 
derived the title Son of God solely from the fact of the Incarnation, or because of His 
relation to the economy of redemption. Therefore, to deny that the Father is a real 
and eternal Father, and that the Son is a real and eternal Son, is a denial of the

a. Conditions to Salvation
Salvation is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord 
Jesus Christ. By the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, being 
justifi ed by grace through faith, man becomes an heir of God according to the hope of 
eternal life (Luke 24:47; John 3:3; Romans 10:13–15; Ephesians 2:8; Titus 2:11; 3:5–7).
b. The Evidences of Salvation
The inward evidence of salvation is the direct witness of the Spirit (Romans 8:16). 
The outward evidence to all men is a life of righteousness and true holiness (Ephe-
sians 4:24; Titus 2:12).
 6. THE ORDINANCES OF THE CHURCH
a. Baptism in Water
The ordinance of baptism by immersion is commanded in the Scriptures. All who 
repent and believe on Christ as Savior and Lord are to be baptized. Thus they declare 
to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with

[27] repent and believe on Christ as Savior and Lord are to be baptized. Thus they declare 
to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with 
Him to walk in newness of life (Matthew 28:19; Mark 16:16; Acts 10:47,48; Romans 6:4).
b. Holy Communion
The Lord’s Supper, consisting of the elements—bread and the fruit of the vine—is 
the symbol expressing our sharing the divine nature of our Lord Jesus Christ (2 Peter 
1:4); a memorial of His suffering and death (1 Corinthians 11:26); and a prophecy of His 
second coming (1 Corinthians 11:26); and is enjoined on all believers “till He come!”
7. THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
All believers are entitled to and should ardently expect and earnestly seek the 
promise of the Father, the baptism in the Holy Spirit and fi  re, according to the com-
mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the

[28] mand of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early 
Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the 
bestowment of the gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry (Luke 24:49; Acts 
1:4,8; 1 Corinthians 12:1–31). This experience is distinct from and subsequent to the 
experience of the new birth (Acts 8:12–17; 10:44–46; 11:14–16; 15:7–9). With the bap-
tism in the Holy Spirit come such experiences as an overfl  owing fullness of the Spirit 
(John 7:37–39; Acts 4:8), a deepened reverence for God (Acts 2:43; Hebrews 12:28), an 
intensifi ed consecration to God and dedication to His work (Acts 2:42), and a more 
active love for Christ, for His Word, and for the lost (Mark 16:20).
8. THE INITIAL PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical 
sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts

[29] The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical 
sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts 
2:4). The speaking in tongues in this instance is the same in essence as the gift of 
tongues (1 Corinthians 12:4–10,28), but different in purpose and use.

11. THE MINISTRY
A divinely called and scripturally ordained ministry has been provided by our Lord 
for the fourfold purpose of leading the Church in: (1) evangelization of the world (Mark 
16:15–20), (2) worship of God (John 4:23,24), (3) building a Body of saints being per-
fected in the image of His Son (Ephesians 4:11,16), and (4) meeting human need with 
ministries of love and compassion (Psalm 112:9; Galatians 2:10; 6:10; James 1:27).
12. DIVINE HEALING
Divine healing is an integral part of the gospel. Deliverance from sickness is pro-
vided for in the Atonement, and is the privilege of all believers (Isaiah 53:4,5; Mat-
thew 8:16,17; James 5:14–16).
13. THE BLESSED HOPE
The resurrection of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and their translation 
together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).

[31] together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the 
imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; 
Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).
14. THE MILLENNIAL REIGN OF CHRIST
The second coming of Christ includes the rapture of the saints, which is our 
blessed hope, followed by the visible return of Christ with His saints to reign on 
the earth for one thousand years (Zechariah 14:5; Matthew 24:27,30; Revelation 1:7; 
19:11–14; 20:1–6). This millennial reign will bring the salvation of national Israel (Eze-
kiel 37:21,22; Zephaniah 3:19,20; Romans 11:26,27) and the establishment of univer-
sal peace (Isaiah 11:6–9; Psalm 72:3–8; Micah 4:3,4).
15. THE FINAL JUDGMENT
There will be a fi  nal judgment in which the wicked dead will be raised and judged 
according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to

[32] according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together 
with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to 
everlasting punishment in the lake which burneth with fi  re and brimstone, which is 
the second death (Matthew 25:46; Mark 9:43–48; Revelation 19:20; 20:11–15; 21:8).
16. THE NEW HEAVENS AND THE NEW EARTH
“We, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein 
dwelleth righteousness” (2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 21,22).
Scripture quotations are from the King James Version of the Holy Bible.
